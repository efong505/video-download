Fix articles API CORS issue - missing requests module

- Fixed Lambda ImportModuleError: No module named 'requests'
- Recreated deployment package with all dependencies (requests, urllib3, certifi, etc.)
- Articles API now properly loads and returns CORS headers
- Resolves 502 errors causing CORS header missing issues
- Articles.html page should now load properly

Technical details:
- Previous deployment only included index.py without dependencies
- Lambda function was failing on import, causing 502 errors
- API Gateway returns CORS headers only when Lambda succeeds
- New deployment package: 990KB (includes all modules)
