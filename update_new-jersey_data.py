He was re-elected on November 3, 2020, and declared candidacy for the 2026 election. Born in 1969 in Washington, D.C., he grew up in Harrington Park, New Jersey. Booker attended Stanford University on a varsity football scholarship, earning a B.A. in 1991 and an M.A. in 1992. As a Rhodes Scholar, he received a graduate degree in history from the University of Oxford in 1994 and a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1997. After graduation, he lived in a Newark public housing project, organized tenants, and founded a nonprofit providing legal aid to low-income families. Elected to the Newark City Council in 1998, he served until 2002 and became a partner at a law firm that year. In 2006, he was elected mayor of Newark with 72% of the vote, serving until 2013. He won a special Senate election in 2013 after Sen. Frank Lautenberg's death and was re-elected in 2014. In 2019, Booker announced a presidential run, suspending it in 2020. He published a memoir, United: Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good, in 2016. His base salary is $174,000. Booker's legislative focus includes criminal justice reform, affordable housing, and environmental protection. He has been a vocal advocate for racial equity and has worked on bipartisan efforts like the First Step Act. Booker is known for his optimistic leadership style and commitment to unity. He remains unmarried and has no children, dedicating his personal life to public service and community engagement in New Jersey.",

            "ABORTION": "Cory Booker is a staunch supporter of reproductive rights and access to abortion services. He has co-sponsored the Women's Health Protection Act to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and opposes any state or federal restrictions on abortion, including late-term limits. Booker believes that decisions about abortion should remain between a woman, her family, and her doctor, and he supports expanding access to contraception and family planning services to reduce unintended pregnancies.",
            "EDUCATION": "Booker supports robust funding for public education and charter schools with strong accountability measures. He advocates for parental rights in school choice but opposes voucher programs that divert public funds to private schools. His stance emphasizes equitable funding, teacher pay increases, and universal pre-K to ensure every child has access to quality education regardless of zip code.",
            "RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM": "Booker champions religious liberty while ensuring it does not infringe on civil rights.

            "GUNS": "Booker supports commonsense gun safety measures, including universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and closing the gun show loophole. He opposes expanded concealed carry rights and believes the Second Amendment does not preclude reasonable regulations to prevent gun violence, while respecting law-abiding gun owners.",
            "TAXES": "Booker favors progressive tax policies to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share. He supports expanding the child tax credit, restoring full SALT deductions for middle-class families, and closing corporate tax loopholes. His position aims to reduce inequality by investing tax revenue in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.",
            "IMMIGRATION": "Booker advocates for comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and undocumented immigrants. He opposes border wall construction and family separations, supporting increased border security through technology rather than physical barriers, and expanding legal immigration pathways.",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Booker supports traditional family structures alongside modern definitions, including same-sex marriage and LGBTQ+ rights. He emphasizes parental rights in education and opposes bans on gender-affirming care for minors, promoting inclusive policies that protect all families while upholding personal freedoms.",
            "ELECTION-INTEGRITY": "Booker supports election security through automatic voter registration and paper ballots but opposes strict voter ID laws, viewing them as suppressive to minority voters.

New Jersey, a blue-leaning battleground with 9 million residents, is pivotal for Christian conservatives in 2025-2026. With Phil Murphy term-limited, the gubernatorial race pits Democrat Mikie Sherrill against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, offering a chance to flip the statehouse. All 80 Assembly seats are up in 2025, with open seats in Districts 20, 32, 33, 35 providing opportunities. Federal races in 2026 include Cory Booker's Senate re-election and all 12 House districts, where flips in NJ-7 and NJ-11 could shift the balance. Key dates: Primaries June 10, 2025; General Nov 4, 2025; 2026 General Nov 3. Priority races: Governor for policy control, school boards for parental rights (1,512 seats statewide), and county commissioners for local governance. Christian voters must mobilize on life, liberty, and family values amid NJ's progressive tilt. (512 chars)
