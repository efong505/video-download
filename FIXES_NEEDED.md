# Fixes Needed Before Auto-Summary Feature

## 1. Admin Dashboard Navigation Styling

**Issue**: Admin dashboard header doesn't match videos.html modern navigation style

**Current State (admin.html)**:
- Simple inline links with basic styling
- No hover effects or modern design
- Missing navigation items (Categories, Authors, Upload Video, My Page)

**Target State (videos.html)**:
- Modern dashboard-nav with flex layout
- Rounded pill-style buttons with hover effects
- Complete navigation menu matching other pages
- Responsive mobile design

**Files to Update**:
- `admin.html` - Update header section and add CSS for dashboard-nav styling

## 2. Scripture Lookup Not Working ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Bible verse lookup in create-article.html and edit-article.html stopped working

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Identified issue: Lambda deployment was missing 'requests' module
- ✅ Created new deployment package with all dependencies (requests, urllib3, certifi, charset_normalizer, idna)
- ✅ Deployed fixed Lambda function to AWS
- ✅ Bible verse lookup should now work in create-article.html and edit-article.html

**Code Review Findings**:
- Lambda function has proper get_bible_verse() endpoint at `?action=bible_verse`
- Uses bible-api.com as external API
- Supports KJV, ASV, YLT translations with fallback to KJV
- Has proper CORS headers
- Has error handling for missing requests module

**Frontend Implementation**:
- create-article.html: Uses searchVerse() function
- edit-article.html: Uses lookupVerse() function with modal
- Both call: `ARTICLES_API + '?action=bible_verse&reference=' + ref + '&translation=' + trans`

**Testing**:
- Open `test-bible-lookup.html` in browser
- Test ARTICLES_API endpoint
- Test direct Bible-API.com access
- Check browser console for errors

**Root Cause**:
- ✅ Lambda was missing 'requests' module in deployment package
- The module was in the folder but not included in the previous deployment zip

**Files Reviewed**:
- ✅ `create-article.html` - searchVerse() function looks correct
- ✅ `edit-article.html` - lookupVerse() function looks correct
- ✅ `articles_api/index.py` - get_bible_verse() function looks correct
- ✅ Created `test-bible-lookup.html` - diagnostic tool

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix admin dashboard navigation to match videos.html (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ Debug scripture lookup issue (COMPLETED)
   - Diagnosed with test-bible-lookup.html
   - Added requests module to Lambda deployment
   - Deployed fixed version to AWS
3. Then proceed with auto-summary feature for resources
