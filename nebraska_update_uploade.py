## 🔴 Nebraska POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Cornhusker State**

Nebraska is a **deep-red conservative stronghold**:
- **Legislature:** Unicameral body with 33-vote Republican supermajority enabling bold pro-life and pro-family reforms.
- **Federal Delegation:** All five congressional seats Republican-held; U.S. Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts anchor conservative priorities.
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Omaha and Lincoln lean purple with Democratic mayors, but rural counties overwhelmingly conservative; Douglas and Lancaster Counties key battlegrounds.
- **Unique State Factor:** Nonpartisan unicameral legislature fosters bipartisan deals but recent sessions dominated by culture-war wins like 12-week abortion ban.

### **Why Nebraska Matters**

Nebraska is **CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:
- ✅ **Pro-Life Leadership:** 12-week ban enshrined via Initiative 434 (2024); no exceptions for rape/incest; highest pregnancy resource centers per capita.
- ✅ **Second Amendment:** Permitless carry law (2023); top-10 gun-friendly state with minimal restrictions.
- ✅ **School Choice:** Opportunity Scholarships provide $10M+ annually; recent expansions despite union opposition.
- ✅ **Religious Liberty:** Strong RFRA protections; faith-based adoption agencies defended against discrimination suits.
- ✅ **Family Values:** Bans on gender-affirming care for minors (2023); traditional marriage upheld in constitution.
- ✅ **Election Integrity:** Voter ID implemented (2024); paper ballots standard.
