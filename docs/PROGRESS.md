## Bible Verse Insertion Troubleshooting & Resolution ✅ COMPLETE
**Problem**: JavaScript syntax error "string literal contains an unescaped line break" when inserting Bible verses

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Bible API (bible-api.com) returns verse text containing actual line breaks (\n, \r)
2. Line breaks in JavaScript template literals and string concatenation caused syntax errors
3. Multiple template literals throughout create-article.html needed conversion
4. CORS issues with Articles API due to missing dependencies in deployment package

**Troubleshooting Steps Performed**:
1. **Initial Fix Attempt**: Replaced onclick attributes with data attributes - FAILED
2. **Template Literal Removal**: Systematically removed all template literals from JavaScript - PARTIAL SUCCESS
3. **DOM Element Creation**: Switched to programmatic DOM element creation - PARTIAL SUCCESS
4. **String Concatenation**: Converted all template literals to string concatenation - PARTIAL SUCCESS
5. **Cache Bypass**: Created create-article-v2.html with different approach - FAILED
6. **API Investigation**: Identified Bible API returning unescaped line breaks - ROOT CAUSE FOUND

**Final Resolution**:
1. **Backend Fix**: Modified Articles API `get_bible_verse()` function to clean verse text:
   - Remove line breaks: `.replace('\n', ' ').replace('\r', ' ')`
   - Normalize whitespace: `' '.join(verse_text.split())`
   - Strip extra spaces: `.strip()`

2. **Deployment Fix**: Recreated Lambda deployment package with all dependencies:
   - Included requests, urllib3, certifi, charset_normalizer, idna modules
   - Fixed CORS headers to always return properly
   - Added error handling for missing dependencies

3. **JavaScript Cleanup**: Removed all template literals from create-article.html:
   - Converted fetch URLs to string concatenation
   - Replaced template literal variables with string concatenation
   - Ensured no backticks remain in JavaScript code

**Technical Details**:
- **Files Modified**: `articles_api/index.py`, `create-article.html`
- **API Endpoint**: Bible verse lookup now returns cleaned text
- **Deployment**: Lambda function redeployed with proper dependency package
- **Testing**: Verified Bible verse insertion works without syntax errors

**Lessons Learned**:
- External API responses must be sanitized for frontend consumption
- Template literals with dynamic content containing line breaks cause JavaScript syntax errors
- Lambda deployment packages must include all required dependencies
- CORS issues often indicate backend Lambda function failures (502 errors)

**Verification**: ✅ Users can now click "My Page" to view their personal content gallery

## User Upload Access Fix ✅ COMPLETE
**Problem**: Regular users getting "Admin or Super User access required" error when trying to upload videos via user-upload.html

**Root Cause**: Admin API was checking admin privileges for ALL requests before handling upload_url endpoint, causing 403 errors for regular users

**Technical Issue**: 
- Admin API flow: verify_admin_token() → then verify_token_only() for upload_url
- First admin check was failing and returning 403 before reaching the user-specific logic
- JavaScript error: Duplicate `const AUTH_API` declaration preventing uploadVideo function from loading

**Resolution**:
1. **Admin API Fix**: Moved upload_url endpoint check before admin token verification
   - upload_url now uses verify_token_only() without admin check first
   - All other endpoints still require admin/super_user privileges
2. **JavaScript Fix**: Removed duplicate AUTH_API constant declaration in user-upload.html
   - Fixed "uploadVideo is not defined" error
   - Upload functionality now loads properly

**Files Modified**:
- `admin_api/index.py` - Reordered endpoint handling logic

**Verification**: ✅ Regular users can now successfully upload videos with proper quota enforcement

## Thumbnail Generation Troubleshooting & Resolution ✅ COMPLETE
**Problem**: Lambda thumbnail-generator function failing with 404 errors, preventing thumbnail creation for uploaded videos like "antifa-out-of-work.mp4"

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Lambda function successfully found video files in S3
2. Error occurred during thumbnail existence check using `s3_client.head_object()`
3. Exception handling for `s3_client.exceptions.NoSuchKey` not working properly in Lambda environment
4. When thumbnail didn't exist (expected behavior), 404 error bubbled up causing function failure

**Troubleshooting Process**:
1. **Initial Investigation**: Confirmed video file exists in S3 bucket (antifa-out-of-work.mp4, 941248 bytes)
2. **Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging to identify exact failure point
3. **Lambda Testing**: Manual function invocation revealed 404 error during thumbnail check
4. **CloudWatch Analysis**: Logs showed video file found successfully, but thumbnail check failing
5. **Exception Handling Fix**: Modified exception handling to catch generic exceptions and check error messages

**Technical Resolution**:
- **File Modified**: `thumbnail_generator/index.py`
- **Fix Applied**: Changed exception handling from `s3_client.exceptions.NoSuchKey` to generic exception with string checking
- **Logic**: Check if exception contains 'NoSuchKey' or '404' in error message
- **Result**: Function now properly handles non-existent thumbnails and continues with generation

**Verification**:
- ✅ Successfully generated thumbnail: `antifa-out-of-work_thumb_2.jpg` (60,882 bytes)
- ✅ Lambda function returns 200 status code
- ✅ Video duration detection working: 9.67 seconds, timestamp: 4.83 seconds
- ✅ FFmpeg processing successful with proper S3 upload

## Video Category Ordering System Fix ✅ COMPLETE (December 2024)
**Problem**: Video category ordering system not working - categories saved in admin panel but not reflecting on videos page

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Case Sensitivity Issue**: sortCategoriesByPriority() function was comparing categories with saved order using case-sensitive indexOf(), but priority order wasn't normalized to lowercase
2. **Hardcoded Category List**: Admin panel was using hardcoded category list instead of dynamically loading actual video categories
3. **Missing Categories**: New categories like "prophecy" weren't appearing in admin panel for reordering because they weren't in the hardcoded list

**Technical Issues Identified**:
- **videos.html**: Category comparison failing due to case mismatch between actual categories and saved order
- **admin.html**: loadCategoryOrder() function using static array instead of fetching actual video categories
- **Refresh Mechanism**: Category order changes saving but not reflecting due to comparison failures

**Resolution Process**:
1. **Case-Insensitive Comparison Fix**: Modified sortCategoriesByPriority() in videos.html
   - Added normalization: `const normalizedPriorityOrder = priorityOrder.map(cat => cat.toLowerCase())`
   - Fixed comparison to use normalized order for indexOf() operations
   - Maintained original category names for display while ensuring proper sorting

2. **Dynamic Category Loading**: Enhanced loadCategoryOrder() in admin.html
   - Changed from hardcoded array to dynamic API call to TAG API
   - Extracts actual categories from video tags (using first tag as primary category)
   - Merges saved order with actual categories to include new categories
   - Automatically adds new categories like "prophecy" to the ordering interface

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Files Modified**:
  - `videos.html` - Fixed case-insensitive category comparison in sortCategoriesByPriority()
  - `admin.html` - Implemented dynamic category loading from actual video data

## Articles Page Loading Issue Resolution ✅ COMPLETE (December 2024)

### Issue Summary
**Problem**: Articles page experienced infinite loading for admin/super_user accounts while working fine for regular users.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Admin Privilege Escalation**: Admin accounts attempted to load ALL private articles from ALL users when requesting `visibility=private`
- **Database Performance**: Large dataset queries caused database timeouts (>30 seconds)
- **Role-Based Loading Disparity**: Regular users only loaded their own private articles (fast), while admins loaded everything (slow)

### Technical Details
**Before Fix:**
```javascript
// Admin tried to load ALL private articles from everyone
const privateResponse = await fetch(`${ARTICLES_API}?action=list&visibility=private`);
```

**After Fix:**
```javascript
// Admin attempts all articles with timeout protection + fallback
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000);
const privateResponse = await fetch(`${ARTICLES_API}?action=list&visibility=private`, {
    signal: controller.signal
});
```

### Solution Implemented
1. **Timeout Protection**: 10-second timeout prevents infinite loading

### Create Article Page Stability Issue & Resolution

**Recurring Problem**: The create-article.html page repeatedly broke with JavaScript parsing errors, causing:
- Templates failing to load
- JavaScript code displaying as HTML text instead of executing
- Rich text editor not initializing properly

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- **Modern JavaScript Syntax Incompatibility**: The environment couldn't parse modern ES6+ syntax
- **Template Literals**: Backticks (`) caused parsing failures
- **Arrow Functions**: `() => {}` syntax not supported
- **const/let Keywords**: Mixed usage with `var` caused issues
- **Complex Dependencies**: Over-reliance on external APIs without fallbacks

**Final Solution - Working Version Characteristics**:
1. **Consistent Older Syntax**: Used `var` throughout, no `const`/`let` mixing
2. **Function Declarations**: Used `function()` instead of arrow functions  
3. **String Concatenation**: Replaced template literals with `+` operators
4. **Promise Chains**: Used `.then()/.catch()` instead of async/await
5. **Fallback Templates**: Built-in templates when API fails
6. **Simplified Error Handling**: Robust fetch error handling with graceful degradation
7. **Delayed Initialization**: `setTimeout()` for template loading to prevent race conditions

**Key Insight**: The working version prioritized **simplicity and compatibility** over modern JavaScript features, with **fallback mechanisms** ensuring the page never completely breaks even if external APIs fail.

**Stability Measures Implemented**:
- Fallback template system when API unavailable
- Error boundaries for all fetch operations  
- Simplified function implementations
- Consistent variable declaration patterns
- Graceful degradation for all features

This approach resolved the recurring breakage and created a stable, reliable create article interface.

## Markdown Support Implementation ✅ COMPLETE (January 2025)

- `convertHtmlToMarkdown()` - Converts rich text to markdown syntax with HTML entity decoding
- `getCurrentContent()` - Returns content from active editor mode for form submission
- `showMarkdownHelp()` - Displays markdown syntax reference guide

### HTML Entity Decoding Fix
**Problem**: HTML entities like `&#39;` (apostrophes) weren't displaying properly in markdown mode
**Solution**: Added HTML entity decoding using temporary DOM element:
```javascript
const tempDiv = document.createElement('div');
tempDiv.innerHTML = html;
const decodedHtml = tempDiv.innerHTML;
```
**Result**: Text like "It&#39;s all about perception" now correctly displays as "It's all about perception"

## Quill Editor List Preservation Fix ✅ COMPLETE (January 2025)

### Issue Summary
**Problem**: When editing articles with unordered lists (bullet points), the list items would disappear when the page loaded, even before switching to markdown mode.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Initial Assumption**: The issue was in the `convertHtmlToMarkdown()` function not properly handling list conversion.
**Actual Cause**: Quill editor was sanitizing HTML content when loaded using `quill.root.innerHTML = article.content`, removing list structures it didn't recognize.

### Technical Investigation
**Debugging Process**:
1. Added debug logging to see HTML structure from database vs. after Quill processing
2. Attempted multiple regex fixes for list conversion patterns
3. Tried handling Quill's `data-list` attributes vs. traditional `<ul>/<li>` tags
4. Discovered the issue occurred during content loading, not markdown conversion

### Solution Implemented
**Fix**: Changed content loading method in `populateForm()` function:
```javascript
// Before (caused list sanitization):
quill.root.innerHTML = article.content;

// After (preserves list structure):
const delta = quill.clipboard.convert(article.content);
quill.setContents(delta);
```

### Technical Details
**Why This Works**:
- `quill.clipboard.convert()` properly parses HTML content using Quill's internal HTML parser
- `quill.setContents()` sets content using Quill's Delta format, preserving all formatting
- This method respects Quill's content model instead of bypassing it with direct HTML injection

**Files Modified**:
- `edit-article.html` - Updated `populateForm()` function to use proper Quill content loading
- Removed debug logging after confirming fix worked

### Key Insight
**Lesson Learned**: When working with rich text editors like Quill, always use the editor's official content loading methods rather than directly manipulating the DOM. Direct HTML injection can cause the editor to sanitize or reject content that doesn't match its internal format expectations.

**Best Practice**: Use `quill.clipboard.convert()` and `quill.setContents()` for loading HTML content into Quill editors to ensure proper content preservation and formatting.

### Verification
- ✅ List items now preserve when editing articles
- ✅ Markdown conversion works properly with preserved lists
- ✅ No content loss during page loading
- ✅ Both WYSIWYG and markdown modes handle lists correctly

**Status**: Quill editor list preservation issue resolved - articles with bullet points now load and edit properly without content loss.

## Editor Role System & Approval Workflow ✅ COMPLETE (January 2025)

### System Overview
**Feature**: Comprehensive 3-tier role system with approval workflow for editor submissions, allowing trusted contributors to manage state election content with admin oversight.

### Role Hierarchy Implemented
1. **Super User / Admin**: Full system access, can approve/deny editor submissions, manage all content
2. **Editor**: Can create/edit candidates, races, events, and summaries for assigned states, submissions require approval unless bypass enabled
3. **Regular User**: Read-only access to public content

### Core Features
**Approval Workflow**:
- Editor submissions go to `pending-changes` DynamoDB table
- Admins notified via email when new submissions arrive
- Admin review interface (admin-pending-changes.html) with approve/deny buttons
- Approved changes automatically applied to live data
- Denied changes remain in pending table with status tracking

**Bypass Approval System**:
- Admin-controlled toggle for trusted editors
- When enabled, editor submissions publish immediately without review
- Visual badges: "Needs Approval" (blue) vs "Auto-Approve" (yellow)
- Checkbox in contributor edit form (admin-only access)

**Pending Count Badge**:
- Real-time count of pending submissions in navbar
- Red badge shows number (e.g., "📋 Pending Changes (2)")
- Updates every 30 seconds automatically
- Hides when count is 0
- Only visible to admins/super_users

**Party Selection Enhancement**:
- Dropdown in candidate form with 7 options: Republican, Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Green, Constitution, Other
- Color-coded party badges on election map:
  - Republican = Red "R"
  - Democrat = Blue "D"
  - Independent = Gray "IND"
  - Libertarian = Yellow "L"
  - Green = Green "G"
  - Other = First 3 letters in gray

### Technical Implementation
**Database Schema**:
- **pending-changes table**: change_id (PK), change_type, data, submitted_by, submitted_at, status, state, reviewed_by, reviewed_at
- **contributors table**: Added `bypass_approval` boolean field
- **users table**: Uses user_id as primary key (not email)

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /contributors?resource=pending-changes` - Submit change for review
- `GET /contributors?resource=pending-changes` - List pending changes (admin only)
- `PUT /contributors?resource=pending-changes` - Approve/deny change (admin only)
- `GET /contributors?resource=users` - List users for contributor dropdown (editor+ access)

**Permission Checks**:
- `verify_admin_token()` - Super user and admin access
- `verify_editor_token()` - Editor, admin, and super user access
- `is_editor_for_state()` - Checks contributor assignment for specific state
- `has_bypass_approval()` - Checks if editor has auto-approve privilege

**Frontend Components**:
- `admin-pending-changes.html` - Review interface with approve/deny buttons
- `admin-contributors.html` - Enhanced with pending count badge and bypass approval checkbox
- `election-map.html` - Fixed party badge display logic

### Workflow Process
1. **Editor Creates Content**: Editor submits candidate/race/event/summary for assigned state
2. **Approval Check**: System checks if editor has bypass_approval enabled
3. **Pending Queue**: If approval required, submission goes to pending-changes table
4. **Admin Notification**: Email sent to all admins/super_users about new submission
5. **Admin Review**: Admin views submission in pending changes interface
6. **Approve/Deny**: Admin clicks approve (applies to live data) or deny (marks as denied)
7. **Status Update**: Change status updated with reviewer info and timestamp

### Auto-Role Assignment
**Feature**: When contributor is created, system automatically assigns editor role to user
**Process**:
1. Admin creates contributor with user email
2. Lambda scans users table for matching email
3. Gets user_id from matched user record
4. Updates user role field to 'editor'
5. User can now submit content for their assigned state

### User Selection Enhancement
**Feature**: Contributor form uses dropdown populated from users table instead of manual email entry
**Benefits**:
- Prevents typos in email addresses
- Shows user names alongside emails
- Auto-fills first/last name from user record
- Ensures only registered users can be contributors

### UI Permission Controls
**Admin Dashboard**:
- Editors see limited tabs: Contributors (read-only), Races, Candidates, Events, Summaries
- Editors cannot see: Bulk Import tab, Admin Dashboard link, Pending Changes link
- Editors cannot: Add/edit/delete contributors, manage users
- Admins see all tabs and full functionality

**Badge System**:
- Blue "Needs Approval" badge = editor requires review for submissions
- Yellow "Auto-Approve" badge = editor's submissions publish immediately
- Badge shows on contributor list for quick identification
- Helps admins identify which editors are trusted vs need moderation

### Files Modified
- `contributors_api/index.py` - Added pending changes logic, bypass approval checks, auto-role assignment
- `admin-contributors.html` - Added pending count badge, bypass approval checkbox, party dropdown, user selection dropdown
- `admin-pending-changes.html` - Created review interface with approve/deny functionality
- `election-map.html` - Fixed party badge display logic with case-insensitive comparison

### Scripts Created
- `create_pending_changes_table.py` - Creates DynamoDB table for pending submissions
- `assign_editor_role.py` - Manually assign editor role to users
- `check_user_role.py` - Check user role by email
- `check_all_users_and_pending.py` - Diagnostic script for users and pending changes
- `check_candidate_party.py` - Verify party field values in database

### Key Insights
**Database Design**:
- Users table uses user_id as primary key (not email)
- Contributors table links to users via email (not user_id)
- Pending changes store complete data object for replay on approval
- Status field tracks: pending, approved, denied

**Security**:
- JWT token validation on all API endpoints
- Role-based access control at API level
- State-based permissions for editors
- Admin-only access to approval workflow

**User Experience**:
- Clear visual feedback with badges and counts
- Popup confirmation when editor submits content
- Email notifications keep admins informed
- One-click approve/deny workflow
- Automatic role assignment reduces admin workload

### Troubleshooting & Fixes
**Issue 1**: Pending changes not appearing in admin interface
- **Cause**: API URL mismatch (yvqx5yjqo3 vs hzursivfuk)
- **Fix**: Updated admin-pending-changes.html to use correct API URL

**Issue 2**: 403 Forbidden errors when loading pending changes
- **Cause**: localStorage key mismatch (authToken vs auth_token)
- **Fix**: Updated to use correct auth_token key

**Issue 3**: Party showing as "IND" for Republican candidates
- **Cause**: Party badge logic defaulting to party value or 'IND'

## State Summaries Markdown/Rich Text Editor Enhancement ✅ COMPLETE (January 2025)

### Feature Overview
**Enhancement**: Implemented seamless dual-mode content editor for state election summaries with markdown and rich text editing capabilities.

### Implementation Details
**Core Features Added**:
- **Mode Toggle Buttons**: 📝 Rich Text Editor and 📄 Markdown Mode with visual styling and emoji labels
- **Separate Content Storage**: Independent `markdownContent` and `htmlContent` variables for seamless mode switching
- **Bidirectional Conversion**: Automatic markdown-to-HTML rendering when switching to Rich Text mode
- **Content Preservation**: No data loss when toggling between modes - each mode maintains its own content
- **Auto-Detection**: System detects content type on load (HTML vs markdown) and sets appropriate mode
- **Preview Functionality**: Renders markdown properly using marked.js in both modes
- **Clean List Display**: Summaries list shows rendered text preview instead of raw markdown/HTML

### Technical Implementation
**Mode Switching Logic**:
```javascript
// Markdown Mode: Saves current content, displays textarea
function switchToMarkdown() {
    if (!isMarkdownMode && summaryEditor) {
        htmlContent = summaryEditor.root.innerHTML;
    }
    document.getElementById('summary-content').value = markdownContent;
}

// Rich Text Mode: Saves markdown, renders to HTML in Quill editor
function switchToRichText() {
    if (isMarkdownMode) {
        markdownContent = document.getElementById('summary-content').value;
    }
    if (htmlContent) {
        summaryEditor.root.innerHTML = htmlContent;
    } else if (markdownContent) {
        summaryEditor.root.innerHTML = marked.parse(markdownContent);
    }
}
```

**Content Detection on Load**:
```javascript
const content = summary.content || '';
if (content.startsWith('<')) {
    htmlContent = content;  // HTML content
    markdownContent = '';
} else {
    markdownContent = content;  // Markdown content
    htmlContent = '';
}
```

**List Display Enhancement**:
```javascript
const renderedPreview = content.startsWith('<') ? content : marked.parse(content);
const textPreview = renderedPreview.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '').substring(0, 200);
// Shows clean text instead of markdown syntax or HTML tags
```

### Files Modified
- `admin-contributors.html` - Complete dual-mode editor implementation
  - Added mode toggle buttons with emoji labels
  - Implemented separate content storage variables
  - Enhanced preview and save functions
  - Fixed summaries list to show clean text preview
  - Added auto-detection for content type on load

### User Experience Features
**Markdown Mode Benefits**:
- Fast typing for markdown-familiar users
- Plain textarea for pasting raw markdown
- Monospace font for syntax clarity
- No HTML wrapping or conversion
- Direct markdown-to-database storage

**Rich Text Mode Benefits**:
- Visual WYSIWYG editing with Quill.js
- Toolbar for formatting (headers, bold, italic, lists, links)
- Rendered markdown preview
- HTML output for rich formatting
- No markdown syntax knowledge required

**Seamless Switching**:
- Toggle between modes without data loss
- Markdown automatically renders when switching to Rich Text
- HTML preserved when switching back to Markdown
- Each mode maintains independent content
- Preview works correctly in both modes

### Key Improvements
**Problem 1**: Quill editor treating pasted markdown as plain text, wrapping in HTML tags
**Solution**: Separate storage for markdown and HTML, no automatic syncing between modes

**Problem 2**: Switching from Rich Text to Markdown showed HTML code instead of markdown
**Solution**: Independent content variables - markdown stays as markdown, HTML stays as HTML

**Problem 3**: Summaries list showing raw markdown syntax (# headers, ** bold, etc.)
**Solution**: Render markdown to HTML, strip tags, show clean text preview (first 200 chars)

### Technical Insights
**Key Patterns**:
- Separate content storage prevents mode-switching data corruption
- marked.js library handles markdown-to-HTML conversion
- Quill editor loads HTML via `root.innerHTML` for proper rendering
- Content type detection uses `startsWith('<')` to identify HTML
- Preview function works with both markdown and HTML content
- List display strips HTML tags for clean text preview

**Integration Points**:
- State summaries stored in DynamoDB `state-summaries` table
- API endpoint: `/contributors?resource=summaries`
- Markdown rendering on election-map.html using marked.js
- Admin panel manages summaries with full CRUD operations

### Verification
- ✅ Mode toggle buttons visible with emoji labels
- ✅ Seamless switching between markdown and rich text modes
- ✅ No data loss when toggling modes
- ✅ Markdown renders properly in Rich Text mode
- ✅ HTML preserved when switching back to Markdown
- ✅ Preview function works in both modes
- ✅ Summaries list shows clean text instead of raw markdown
- ✅ Content type auto-detected on load (HTML vs markdown)
- ✅ Save function captures content from active mode

**Status**: State summaries dual-mode editor fully operational - users can seamlessly toggle between markdown and rich text editing with complete content preservation and proper rendering in all views.

### Election Map Display Enhancements ✅ COMPLETE (January 2025)
**Problem 1**: Candidates not displaying under races despite being imported
**Root Cause**: Candidates had empty string `race_id` values instead of matching race IDs
**Resolution**: 
- Added debug logging to diagnose race_id matching issues
- Updated CSV import to auto-match candidates to races by state + office
- Candidates now automatically linked to races during bulk import

**Problem 2**: All candidates labeled as "Republican" regardless of actual party
**Root Cause**: Page title said "Republican Candidates" and no party badges displayed
**Resolution**:
- Changed section title from "🎯 Republican Candidates" to "🎯 Candidates"
- Added party badge system with color coding:
  - Red badge (R) for Republicans
  - Blue badge (D) for Democrats
  - Gray badge for Independents, Libertarians, Green, Constitution, and other parties
  - Displays full party name for third parties

**Problem 3**: US map cut off on mobile devices (only left half visible)
**Root Cause**: Fixed SVG dimensions not responsive to mobile screen sizes
**Resolution**:
- Added SVG `viewBox="0 0 960 600"` for proper scaling
- Added `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"` to center map
- Set width/height to 100% for container-based sizing
- Added mobile media query to reduce height on small screens
- Map now displays full US on all device sizes

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Files Modified**: `election-map.html`, `admin-contributors.html`
- **Party Badge Logic**: Conditional rendering based on party field value
- **Auto-Matching**: `allRaces.find(r => r.state === state && r.office === office)`
- **Responsive SVG**: ViewBox-based scaling instead of fixed dimensions

**Features Added**:
- Multi-party support with visual distinction
- Mobile-responsive US map display
- Automatic race-to-candidate linking during CSV import
- Debug logging for troubleshooting race_id issues
- Empty string race_id handling

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Clear visual party identification with colored badges
- Full map visibility on mobile devices
- Simplified CSV import workflow (no manual race_id entry needed)
- Support for all political parties (not just R/D)

**CSV Import Workflow**:
1. Import races first (generates race_id automatically)
2. Import candidates second (auto-matches to races by state + office)
3. System automatically assigns correct race_id to candidates
4. No manual ID management required

**Verification**: ✅ Party badges display correctly, mobile map shows full US, candidates properly linked to races via auto-matching

### Future Enhancement: Dedicated Comparative Race View (Optional)
**Current State**: 
- Candidates linked via `race_id` field for grouping
- Policy positions stored (abortion, guns, immigration, religious freedom, taxes, education)
- Endorsements and faith statements displayed
- Side-by-side display on election map when clicking states

**Proposed Enhancement**:
- **Head-to-Head Comparison Matrix**: Side-by-side table comparing candidates in same race
- **Issue-by-Issue Breakdown**: Visual comparison of policy positions with color coding
- **Opponent Field**: Direct 1-on-1 linking in CSV (opponent_name column)
- **Polling Data Integration**: Add polling numbers and trends to CSV
- **Debate Schedule**: Track and display upcoming debates
- **Voting Record Comparison**: Side-by-side legislative history
- **Endorsement Comparison**: Visual comparison of endorsing organizations
- **Funding Comparison**: Campaign finance data integration
- **Interactive Comparison Tool**: Allow users to select 2+ candidates for detailed comparison

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Add `opponent_name` and `polling_average` columns to candidates CSV
2. Create `compare-candidates.html` page with comparison matrix
3. Add "Compare" button on election-map.html for races with multiple candidates
4. Build comparison API endpoint to fetch and format candidate data
5. Design visual comparison UI with color-coded position differences
6. Integrate with external polling APIs (RealClearPolitics, FiveThirtyEight)

**Benefits**:
- Easier voter decision-making with clear side-by-side comparisons
- Visual identification of policy differences
- Quick access to key differentiators between candidates
- Enhanced user engagement with interactive comparison tools
- Better informed Christian conservative voters

**CSV Structure Enhancement**:
```csv
name,state,office,party,opponent_name,polling_average,debate_dates,bio,positions,endorsements
Ted Cruz,Texas,U.S. Senate,Republican,Colin Allred,48.5,2024-10-15;2024-10-22,...
Colin Allred,Texas,U.S. Senate,Democrat,Ted Cruz,46.2,2024-10-15;2024-10-22,...
```

**Priority**: Low (current grouping system functional, enhancement would improve UX)
**Effort**: Medium (requires new UI components and comparison logic)
**Value**: High (significantly improves voter information and decision-making)
