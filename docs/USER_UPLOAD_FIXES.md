# User Upload Access & Admin Name Editing Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. User Upload Access Problem
**Issue**: Regular users clicking "Upload Video" were redirected to admin.html and got "admin access required" error.

**Root Cause**: The upload link in videos.html pointed to admin.html which requires admin/super_user role.

**Solution**: 
- Created dedicated `user-upload.html` page for regular users
- Updated videos.html to point to user-upload.html instead of admin.html
- Implemented quota enforcement and upgrade prompts

### 2. Admin Name Editing Issue
**Issue**: Admin/super users unable to edit first/last names in admin dashboard.

**Analysis**: The admin.html interface and admin_api backend code appear correct. The issue may be:
- Deployment/caching problem
- Frontend JavaScript not properly handling responses
- API Gateway configuration issue

**Verification**: Created `test-admin-api.html` to test the API directly.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **user-upload.html** - Dedicated upload interface for regular users
   - Quota display and enforcement
   - File size limits (500MB for regular users)
   - Upgrade prompts when limits reached
   - Tag autocomplete
   - Progress tracking

2. **test-admin-api.html** - API testing tool
   - Tests admin API user management
   - Verifies name editing functionality
   - Debugging tool for admin issues

### Modified Files:
1. **videos.html** - Updated upload link
   - Changed from `admin.html` to `user-upload.html`
   - Regular users now have proper upload access

## Features Implemented

### User Upload Interface:
- **Quota Visualization**: Progress bar showing storage usage
- **Tier Display**: Shows current subscription plan (Free/Premium/Pro/Enterprise)
- **Limit Enforcement**: Prevents uploads exceeding quota
- **Upgrade Prompts**: Encourages plan upgrades when limits reached
- **File Validation**: 500MB limit for regular users
- **Tag Autocomplete**: Suggests existing tags while typing
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress

### Quota System:
- **Free Plan**: 2GB storage, 50 videos
- **Premium Plan**: 25GB storage, 500 videos  
- **Pro Plan**: 100GB storage, 2000 videos
- **Enterprise Plan**: Unlimited storage and videos

## Testing Steps

### For User Upload:
1. Login as regular user
2. Go to Videos page
3. Click "Upload Video" - should go to user-upload.html
4. Upload should work with quota enforcement

### For Admin Name Editing:
1. Login as admin/super_user
2. Go to admin.html
3. Navigate to Users tab
4. Click Edit on any user
5. Try updating first/last name
6. If issues persist, use test-admin-api.html for debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Ensure all files are uploaded to S3/CloudFront
2. **Clear Cache**: Invalidate CloudFront cache for updated files
3. **Test Admin API**: Use test-admin-api.html to verify backend functionality
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check Lambda logs for any errors during name updates
5. **Verify Database**: Ensure DynamoDB users table has first_name/last_name fields

## Quota Enforcement Notes

The quota system is currently implemented in the frontend. For production:
- Consider moving quota checks to backend APIs
- Implement server-side validation
- Add webhook notifications for quota warnings
- Integrate with payment system for automatic upgrades

## Admin API Debugging

If name editing still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify API Gateway deployment
3. Check Lambda function logs
4. Test with test-admin-api.html
5. Verify DynamoDB table schema includes name fields
