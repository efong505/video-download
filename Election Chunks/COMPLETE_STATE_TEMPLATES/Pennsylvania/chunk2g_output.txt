A U.S. Army veteran, Garrity served as a captain in military intelligence during deployments to Iraq and Kuwait, where she earned the nickname 'Angel of the Desert' for her compassionate oversight of a detention center. After her military service, she worked in the private sector as Vice President of Government Affairs at Global Tungsten & Powders, a Pennsylvania-based manufacturing company specializing in electronics and tools. Born in Potter County, Pennsylvania, Garrity grew up in a rural farming community and graduated from Lock Haven University with a degree in international studies and political science. She is married to Ed Garrity, a fellow veteran, and they have two children. As Treasurer, Garrity has focused on fiscal responsibility, returning over $4 billion in unclaimed property to residents, upgrading the Treasury's unclaimed property system, and cutting waste and fees. She has championed transparency in state investments and proposed legislation to streamline returns of small unclaimed amounts under $500 without claims. Her accomplishments include overseeing record distributions to residents and building a broad coalition that bridges Trump and establishment Republicans. Garrity announced her candidacy for Governor in August 2025, receiving the Pennsylvania Republican Party endorsement in September 2025. No specific voting record as she has not served in the legislature, but her tenure as Treasurer demonstrates conservative fiscal management. [Source: Ballotpedia, Wikipedia, Spotlight PA, WHYY]",
