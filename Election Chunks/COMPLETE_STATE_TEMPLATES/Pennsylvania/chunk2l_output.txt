In 2020, she upset the incumbent to become the first Republican Treasurer in 16 years. As Treasurer, Garrity has overseen more than $170 billion in state assets, implemented transparency measures, cut waste, and returned over $1 billion in unclaimed property to residents. She launched the Money Match program, saving taxpayers nearly $10 million, and chairs the national ABLE Savings Plans Network for individuals with disabilities. Garrity has also focused on returning military decorations to veterans, repatriating over 450 items including Purple Hearts.

In 2024, she won re-election with a record 3.5 million votes, the highest for any statewide candidate in Pennsylvania history.
