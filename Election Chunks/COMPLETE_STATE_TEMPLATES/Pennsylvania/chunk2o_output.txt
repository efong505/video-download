A U.S. Army veteran, she served in Iraq where she earned the nickname 'Angel of the Desert' for her compassionate oversight of a detention center. After her military service, Garrity worked as Vice President of Government Affairs at Global Tungsten & Powders, a Pennsylvania-based manufacturing company. She entered politics in 2019 with an unsuccessful bid for Congress in the 12th district. As Treasurer, Garrity has focused on transparency, reducing fees, and returning over $4 billion in unclaimed property to residents. She proposed legislation to streamline unclaimed property returns under $500 without claims. Her tenure includes upgrades to the Treasury's systems and oversight of record distributions. Garrity announced her gubernatorial candidacy in August 2025, earning the Pennsylvania Republican Party endorsement in September 2025. She emphasizes fiscal responsibility, public safety, and economic growth. Married with two children, she resides in Potter Township. No specific voting record as Treasurer, but her initiatives have saved taxpayers millions through audits and efficiency measures. [Source: Wikipedia, Spotlight PA, WHYY, Ballotpedia]",
