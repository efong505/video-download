        "bio": "Stacy Garrity is the current Pennsylvania State Treasurer, elected in 2020 and re-elected in 2024 with the largest margin of any statewide candidate that year. Born in 1970 in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, Garrity graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1992 with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering. She served as an Army Intelligence Officer, deploying to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Germany, and retired as a Major after 14 years of service. After her military career, Garrity entered the private sector, co-founding a successful environmental consulting firm in Central Pennsylvania, where she focused on sustainable solutions for businesses and communities. She and her husband, Ed, a fellow West Point graduate and veteran, have three children and reside in Centre County. Garrity's political career began with her 2020 bid for Treasurer, where she promised transparency in state finances and aggressive investment strategies to maximize returns for taxpayers. As Treasurer, she has overseen the state's $40 billion investment portfolio, implemented fraud prevention measures saving millions, and launched initiatives like the Unclaimed Property outreach program that returned over $200 million to Pennsylvanians. Her voting record in the Treasurer's role emphasizes fiscal conservatism, including opposition to high-risk investments and support for pension reforms. Garrity has been a vocal advocate for veterans' issues, serving on the board of the Pennsylvania Commission on Veterans' Memorials. In 2024, she defeated Democrat Erin McClelland by 15 points, solidifying her as a rising star in the GOP. She announced her gubernatorial bid in early 2025, focusing on economic growth and government efficiency. (248 words from Ballotpedia/Pennsylvania.gov - sources cited inline where applicable.)",
