## 🔴 COUNTY ELECTIONS

Pennsylvania's county elections play a pivotal role in shaping local governance, public policy, and the enforcement of laws that directly impact Christian conservative values across the commonwealth. With sixty-seven counties, each conducting elections for positions such as county commissioners, district attorneys, sheriffs, prothonotaries, registers of wills, and coroners, these races determine who controls property taxes, law enforcement priorities, election administration, and even the handling of vital records that relate to family issues like marriage licenses and death certificates. In many rural and suburban counties, conservative candidates often align with pro-life, pro-family, and pro-Second Amendment platforms, while urban counties like Philadelphia, Allegheny, Montgomery, and Delaware tend to favor progressive policies on social issues. For instance, county commissioners hold authority over budgets that fund health services, including whether taxpayer dollars support abortion providers through indirect grants or partnerships with organizations like Planned Parenthood. District attorneys decide prosecution priorities, influencing whether crimes against religious institutions, such as vandalism of churches, receive vigorous pursuit or lenient treatment. Sheriffs enforce court orders and maintain public order, with some taking strong stands on Second Amendment sanctuaries to protect gun rights from state overreach.

Key battleground counties include Lancaster, York, and Bucks, where Christian conservative turnout can sway commissioner majorities toward fiscal responsibility and traditional values. In Lancaster County, home to a large Amish and Mennonite population, elections for three commissioner seats often hinge on issues like agricultural protections and opposition to expansive government programs that burden family farms. Candidates who pledge to defend religious exemptions for homeschooling and private schools resonate deeply here. Similarly, in Bucks County, a swing area with growing suburban development, the district attorney's race determines approaches to juvenile justice and drug enforcement, with conservatives advocating for tougher penalties on fentanyl traffickers to safeguard families. Philadelphia County, encompassing the city, features consolidated city-county roles where the district attorney has implemented policies criticized by conservatives for reducing prosecutions on certain offenses, leading to calls for reform candidates who prioritize victims' rights and public safety rooted in biblical justice principles.

Further west, Allegheny County, including Pittsburgh, sees intense contests for county executive and council seats, where progressive incumbents push for equity initiatives that conservatives view as discriminatory against faith-based organizations. Erie and Northampton Counties represent additional fronts, with sheriff races focusing on cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, a stance favored by those upholding the rule of law as ordained by God. Across the state, prothonotary offices manage court records, including those for family court divisions handling divorce and custody, making these clerical yet influential positions critical for ensuring fair treatment under the law for traditional families. Registers of wills oversee estate probate, affecting inheritance laws that align with scriptural principles of stewardship. Even coroner elections matter, as these officials investigate deaths, including those from abortions or euthanasia, potentially exposing truths that inform public policy.

Christian conservatives must research candidates through voter guides from organizations like the Pennsylvania Family Institute, attending county Republican or Constitution Party meetings to identify allies. Door-to-door canvassing in neighborhoods, phone banking from church directories, and hosting candidate forums in fellowship halls amplify impact. In counties with mail-in voting controversies, supporting commissioners who audit election processes restores trust. Ultimately, winning at the county level builds a foundation for statewide victories, securing officials who view government as a minister of God for good, as described in Romans chapter thirteen.

## 🔴 KEY ISSUES FOR PENNSYLVANIA CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES

### Life & Family

The conservative position on life and family in Pennsylvania emphatically affirms that human life begins at conception and must be protected from abortion, euthanasia, and any form of devaluation, viewing the unborn child as a person created in the image of God with inherent rights. Conservatives oppose taxpayer funding for abortion providers and advocate for laws requiring informed consent, parental notification for minors, and bans on late-term abortions, except perhaps in extreme cases threatening the mother's life. They support crisis pregnancy centers, adoption incentives, and policies that strengthen the nuclear family as the bedrock of society, resisting efforts to redefine family beyond one man and one woman in marriage with children. In the commonwealth, this means pushing for the defeat of any expansion of abortion rights under the state constitution and promoting legislation like heartbeat bills that detect fetal cardiac activity as early as six weeks.

Conservatives further contend that family policies should prioritize mothers and fathers raising their own children, with tax credits for stay-at-home parents and protections against government intrusion via child protective services unless clear abuse occurs. They highlight how abortion disproportionately affects minority communities and exploits women in vulnerable situations, calling for holistic support including maternity homes and counseling rooted in Christian compassion.

On the progressive side, advocates argue for reproductive rights as essential healthcare, framing abortion as a personal decision between a woman and her doctor, free from government interference. They support codifying Roe versus Wade principles into Pennsylvania law, expanding access through telemedicine abortions and removing restrictions like mandatory ultrasounds or waiting periods, which they deem burdensome. Progressives view family diversity inclusively, endorsing same-sex marriage, adoption by LGBTQ couples, and gender-affirming care for minors as advances in equality. They push for state-funded family planning services that include contraception and abortion, asserting these reduce unintended pregnancies and empower women economically.

Progressives criticize conservative positions as imposing religious beliefs on pluralistic society, advocating for comprehensive sex education in schools that covers consent, orientation, and prevention, rather than abstinence-only approaches.

Action steps for Christian conservatives include voting for pro-life candidates in every race, volunteering at pregnancy resource centers to provide alternatives, and contacting legislators to support bills like the Down Syndrome Protection Act, which prevents abortions based on genetic diagnoses. Organize church prayer vigils outside abortion facilities, distribute voter guides highlighting candidates' records on life issues, and file amicus briefs in court cases challenging abortion expansions. Educate congregations through sermons and Bible studies on the sanctity of life, fostering a culture that celebrates large families and supports foster care within faith communities.

As it is written in Psalm chapter one hundred thirty-nine, verses thirteen through sixteen: "For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them." And in Jeremiah chapter one, verse five: "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations."

### School Choice & Parental Rights

Christian conservatives champion school choice through vouchers, education savings accounts, and tax-credit scholarships, enabling parents to select private, Christian, or homeschool options that align with biblical worldview education, free from state curricula promoting secular humanism or gender ideology. They assert parental rights as God-given authority over child-rearing, opposing mandates for critical race theory, explicit sexual materials in libraries, or transgender policies that confuse children's identities. In Pennsylvania, this involves expanding the Educational Improvement Tax Credit program and Lifeline Scholarships for students in failing public schools to escape environments hostile to faith.

Conservatives argue that government schools increasingly indoctrinate rather than educate, citing examples of drag queen story hours and bathroom policies endangering girls' privacy, demanding transparency in curriculum and the right to opt out without penalty.

Progressives defend public schools as equalizers, opposing choice mechanisms that divert funds from under-resourced districts, claiming vouchers benefit the privileged and undermine community education. They support inclusive curricula teaching historical truths about systemic inequities, diverse family structures, and LGBTQ history, viewing parental objections as censorship that harms marginalized students. Progressives advocate for universal pre-kindergarten and mental health services in schools, framing gender identity discussions as supportive care.

Action steps encompass lobbying for passage of robust school choice bills in the General Assembly, attending school board meetings to challenge objectionable policies, and running for local school boards on platforms of parental notification and curriculum veto rights. Form parent networks to review textbooks, utilize freedom of information requests for transparency, and support legal defenses through alliances like the Pennsylvania Family Institute when rights are violated. Homeschool co-ops should share resources and advocate for tax relief on educational expenses.

Scripture affirms in Deuteronomy chapter six, verses six through nine: "And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates." Proverbs chapter twenty-two, verse six: "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."

### Religious Liberty

Conservatives defend religious liberty as the first freedom, protecting churches, businesses, and individuals from compelled speech or actions violating conscience, such as forcing Christian bakers to participate in same-sex weddings or mandating pronoun usage. In Pennsylvania, this means enacting stronger Religious Freedom Restoration Act standards and shielding faith-based adoption agencies from anti-discrimination lawsuits that force placement with same-sex couples. They highlight pandemic-era church closures as overreach, advocating for houses of worship as essential services.

Conservatives view erosion of these protections as tyranny, insisting government must prove compelling interest and least restrictive means before burdening faith.

Progressives prioritize equality, arguing religious exemptions enable discrimination, particularly against LGBTQ individuals in public accommodations. They support laws requiring service without bias, viewing claims of conscience as covers for prejudice, and favor policies ensuring access to contraception coverage even for religious employers.

Action steps involve testifying at hearings for religious liberty bills, supporting lawsuits through groups like Alliance Defending Freedom, and training church leaders on legal rights. Boycott companies hostile to faith, vote out officials who persecute believers, and build coalitions with other faiths for broad protections.

As stated in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, incorporated via the Fourteenth: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Galatians chapter five, verse one: "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."

### Second Amendment Rights

Christian conservatives uphold the right to keep and bear arms as God-given for self-defense, family protection, and resistance to tyranny, opposing red flag laws, assault weapon bans, or universal background checks that infringe law-abiding citizens. In Pennsylvania, a hunting heritage state, they defend constitutional carry and stand-your-ground laws, viewing gun control as disarming the innocent while criminals ignore restrictions.

Conservatives cite rising crime in cities with strict laws as evidence of failure, promoting armed security in churches post-shootings.

Progressives advocate common-sense reforms like expanded background checks, safe storage mandates, and banning high-capacity magazines to reduce mass shootings and suicides, framing guns as public health crises rather than rights.

Action steps include joining the National Rifle Association or Firearms Owners Against Crime, contacting representatives against restrictive bills, and training in responsible gun ownership through church classes. Support sheriffs declaring Second Amendment sanctuaries.

Exodus chapter twenty-two, verse two: "If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him." Luke chapter twenty-two, verse thirty-six: "Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one."

### Family Values & Marriage

Conservatives define marriage as covenant between one man and one woman, opposing redefinitions that undermine this foundation, and promote policies strengthening intact families through tax incentives and fatherhood initiatives. They resist pornography proliferation and divorce ease, advocating covenant marriages.

Progressives celebrate marriage equality and diverse families, supporting no-fault divorce and protections for cohabiting partners.

Action steps: Host marriage enrichment seminars, mentor youth on chastity, lobby against harmful media regulations.

Genesis chapter two, verse twenty-four: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh." Hebrews chapter thirteen, verse four: "Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."

### Election Integrity

Conservatives demand voter identification, signature verification, and bans on ballot harvesting to prevent fraud, citing past irregularities and calling for audits.

Progressives see such measures as voter suppression targeting minorities, favoring expanded mail voting for accessibility.

Action steps: Volunteer as poll watchers, support cleanup of voter rolls, advocate for paper ballots.

Proverbs chapter fourteen, verse thirty-four: "Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people."

### Taxes & Economic Freedom

Conservatives favor lower taxes, deregulation, and school choice to empower families and businesses, opposing wealth redistribution.

Progressives support progressive taxation for social programs addressing inequality.

Action steps: Endorse flat tax proposals, start faith-based businesses.

Proverbs chapter thirteen, verse twenty-two: "A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just."

### Crime & Public Safety

Conservatives back law enforcement, harsher penalties, and broken-windows policing to deter crime biblically.

Progressives push reform, addressing root causes like poverty.

Action steps: Support faith-based prisoner reentry, advocate victims' rights.

Romans chapter thirteen, verses three through four: "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."

## 🔴 CHURCH MOBILIZATION STRATEGY

Pastors hold immense influence in mobilizing congregations for civic engagement without jeopardizing tax-exempt status by focusing on issues, not candidates. They can preach biblical citizenship series drawing from scriptures on government and justice, inviting speakers from policy councils to educate on current legislation. Host voter registration drives after services, distribute nonpartisan voter guides, and organize prayer walks for the nation. Form church election teams to coordinate transportation to polls, especially for elderly members, and partner with pregnancy centers for service opportunities that highlight life issues. Pastors should model involvement by serving on community boards and encouraging members to run for local office, providing pulpit endorsements for principles like sanctity of life.

Church members complement pastoral leadership through personal activism, starting with informed voting based on candidates' alignment with scriptural values. They can canvass neighborhoods with literature, host home Bible studies discussing policy through a Christian lens, and use social media to share truth respectfully. Volunteer for campaigns of principled candidates, phone bank from home, and babysit for parents attending meetings. Members should tithe time to mentor youth in civics, organize carpool poll efforts, and fast weekly for elections.

## 🔴 CRITICAL DATES

The primary election occurs on the third Tuesday in May, determining party nominees for November contests; prepare by registering thirty days prior. General election day falls on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, a national holiday for voting; churches can serve as polls. Voter registration deadlines are fifteen days before each election, requiring drives well in advance. Mail ballot applications must submit by the Tuesday before election week, with returns by eight post meridiem on election day. Early in-person voting availability varies by county, often starting weeks prior.

## 🔴 RESOURCES

The Pennsylvania Family Institute offers voter guides, policy briefs, and legal aid at pafamily.org, equipping believers with research. Tony Perkins' Stand firm app provides daily updates on national issues affecting the state. Heritage Foundation's Election Integrity Scorecard rates Pennsylvania's laws, guiding advocacy. Local crisis pregnancy centers like AlphaCare in Philadelphia need volunteers and donations. Alliance Defending Freedom litigates religious liberty cases, accepting prayer support.

---

## 🔴 BOTTOM LINE

Pennsylvania stands at a crossroads where control of the legislature, governorship, and courts will determine if the commonwealth honors God in policies on life, family, liberty, and justice or descends into secular progressivism eroding foundational truths. Christian conservatives must engage fully, recognizing apathy cedes ground to forces opposing biblical worldview, with eternal consequences for generations.

## 🔴 PRAYER POINTS

Pray for wisdom for leaders as in First Timothy chapter two, verses one through two: "I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty." Beseech protection over the unborn, revival in churches, and courage for believers to stand boldly.
