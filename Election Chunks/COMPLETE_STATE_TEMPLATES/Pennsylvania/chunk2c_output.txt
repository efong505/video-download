A U.S. Army veteran, she served as a military police officer and deployed to Iraq, where she managed a detention facility and earned the nickname 'Angel of the Desert' for her compassionate leadership. Born in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, Garrity graduated from Lycoming College with a degree in criminal justice. Before entering politics, she owned a small business and served as a township supervisor in Lycoming County. As Treasurer, she has focused on financial transparency, implementing reforms to reduce fees, improving unclaimed property returns, and launching initiatives to combat financial exploitation of seniors. Her tenure includes overseeing the state's $300 billion investment portfolio and advocating for fiscal responsibility. Garrity ran unsuccessfully for U.S. House in Pennsylvania's 12th District in 2019 but built a strong grassroots base. Married to Tim Garrity, a fellow veteran, they have three children. She has been a vocal supporter of veterans' issues and economic growth policies. In the state legislature, she would bring her executive experience to push for tax relief and education funding. Her voting record as Treasurer aligns with conservative fiscal policies, including opposition to expansive government spending. Garrity has positioned herself as a unifier in the Republican Party, appealing to both Trump supporters and moderates. [Source: Ballotpedia.org, Pennsylvania.gov]",
