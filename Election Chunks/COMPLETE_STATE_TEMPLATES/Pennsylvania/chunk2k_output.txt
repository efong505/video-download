She was reelected in 2024 with a record-breaking 3.5 million votes, the highest for any statewide candidate in Pennsylvania history. Garrity grew up in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in administration of justice. She served 13 years in the Army, including deployments to Iraq where she managed a detention facility and earned the nickname 'Angel of the Desert' for her compassionate leadership. After her military service, she worked as Vice President of Government Affairs at Global Tungsten & Powders Corp., a Pennsylvania-based manufacturing company. Garrity entered politics in 2019, running unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District. As Treasurer, she has focused on fiscal responsibility, returning over $4 billion in unclaimed property to residents, upgrading the Treasury's unclaimed property system, and proposing legislation to streamline returns for small amounts under $500 without claims. She has cut fees, improved transparency, and invested state funds ethically, avoiding companies tied to controversial regimes like Russia post-invasion. Garrity is married to Michael Garrity, a fellow veteran, and they have two children. Her accomplishments include broad coalition-building across Republican factions, earning endorsements from both Trump supporters and moderates. No specific voting record as Treasurer, but her tenure emphasizes accountability and taxpayer protection. In August 2025, she announced her candidacy for Governor in 2026, receiving the Pennsylvania Republican Party endorsement in September 2025. [Source: Ballotpedia, Spotlight PA, Wikipedia]",
