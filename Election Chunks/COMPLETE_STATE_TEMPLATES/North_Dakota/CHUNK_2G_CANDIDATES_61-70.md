# CHUNK 2G: NORTH DAKOTA CANDIDATES 61-70

## TASK: Provide UP TO 10 candidates (61-70)

**CRITICAL: Write ALL candidates COMPLETELY. If you write "..." or "[continue]" or abbreviate ANY candidate, you have FAILED.**

**IMPORTANT:** If fewer than 10 viable candidates exist for this range, provide only the real candidates you can find. DO NOT invent fake candidates.

**DO NOT provide:**
- ❌ Races array
- ❌ Summary
- ❌ Other candidate ranges
- ❌ Any explanatory text

**DO provide:**
- ✅ Up to 10 complete candidates (or fewer if that's all that exist)
- ✅ Each: name, state, office, party, status, bio (200-300 words), faith_statement, website, positions (ALL 8), endorsements
