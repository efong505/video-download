        "bio": "Robert 'Bob' Brooks is a lifelong advocate for working families, drawing from his blue-collar roots and decades of service as a firefighter. Raised by a single mother who worked as a bartender, Brooks learned the value of hard work early on, holding jobs like dishwasher, short-order cook, bartender, landscaper, warehouse worker, and pizza delivery driver before settling in Pennsylvania over 30 years ago. In 2005, he joined the Bethlehem Fire Department, serving 20 years and rising through the ranks, holding nearly every position on the fire truck. As president of the Pennsylvania Professional Fire Fighters Association, he fought for higher wages, better healthcare, and mental health coverage for firefighters suffering from post-traumatic stress injury (PTSI), a ten-year battle where he clashed with opponents like Ryan Mackenzie. In 2013, Brooks launched Brooks Lawn Care, a family-run business handling lawn maintenance and snow removal, often working early mornings after long shifts. A dedicated coach, he has led youth and varsity baseball at Nazareth Area High School for over 20 years. Brooks and his wife Jen reside in Nazareth with their four sons—Keith, a volunteer fire chief; Austin, Hunter, and Mason—and two granddaughters, Elliana and Lucy, plus their bulldog Aspen. Retired from firefighting in 2025 to focus on his congressional bid, Brooks' campaign emphasizes economic justice, protecting healthcare, and union rights, positioning himself as a fighter for the Lehigh Valley's working class against billionaire tax breaks and cuts to social services.

Wade into federal law and pass legislation to overturn Trump-era abortion bans in red states. He believes the government has no place dictating personal choices about one's body, emphasizing that decisions on reproductive health should remain between individuals, their families, and healthcare providers. Access to safe, legal abortion is a fundamental right, and Brooks opposes any efforts to restrict it further, such as national bans or defunding Planned Parenthood. As a father and grandfather, he understands the importance of family autonomy in these intimate matters. His position aligns with Democratic priorities to restore protections lost after the Dobbs decision, ensuring equal access to care regardless of zip code or income. Brooks criticizes Republican policies that exacerbate healthcare disparities, particularly for low-income women in rural areas. He pledges to fight for comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including contraception, prenatal care, and support for maternal health, viewing these as essential to empowering women and strengthening families. This stance reflects his broader commitment to protecting vulnerable populations from overreach, drawing from his union advocacy where he fought for workers' rights against powerful interests.

His position balances public safety with constitutional protections, informed by responding to active shooter calls and losing colleagues to violence.

He seeks to repeal the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which could raise $1.5 trillion for debt reduction, healthcare expansion, and safety nets without burdening middle-class families. Brooks supports tying the minimum wage to inflation—unchanged since 2009—and ending corporate loopholes that allow giants like Amazon to pay zero taxes. As a small business owner, he understands the strain of unfair systems on local economies and advocates for deductions for working families, child tax credits, and earned income tax relief. His plan closes offshore havens and insider trading exemptions for Congress, promoting transparency.

His approach includes English classes, citizenship tracks, and protections against trafficking, recognizing immigrants' economic boost—paying billions in taxes yearly.

As a husband, father of four, and grandfather, Brooks knows the joys and challenges of raising kids, from coaching baseball to early-morning plowing while caring for granddaughters.

Brooks supports affordable housing, mental health access, and substance abuse prevention to strengthen communities. His values reject division, promoting compassion, responsibility, and opportunity for all families, informed by his single-mother upbringing and firefighting sacrifices for neighbors. (178 words)",
            "ELECTION-INTEGRITY": "To restore trust in democracy, Bob Brooks pledges to repeal Citizens United, banning corporate PAC money and stock trading by Congress members to end corruption and big-money influence. He supports term limits for lifetime politicians and a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, ensuring elections reflect voters, not donors. As a fighter against special interests, Brooks decries deals like Trump's $400 million Qatar jet or congressional insider trading, calling for inspector general protections and transparency laws. His prosecutorial experience highlights the need for accountability, including prosecuting election crimes and securing voting rights against suppression. Brooks backs automatic voter registration, mail-in expansions, and audits to prevent fraud while easing access. In Pennsylvania, he focuses on fair redistricting and combating disinformation.
