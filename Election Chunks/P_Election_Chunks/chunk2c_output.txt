Elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2012, he represented District 134 until 2022 and then District 187, serving on committees like Commerce, Environmental Resources & Energy, Insurance, and Labor & Industry. In 2024, he defeated incumbent Democrat Susan Wild to flip the seat red. Mackenzie is married with three children and resides in Allentown.

            "ABORTION": "Ryan Mackenzie is a staunch pro-life advocate, committed to fighting the culture of abortion and protecting the unborn. He opposes efforts to legalize abortion up until birth, criticizing Democrats like his predecessor Susan Wild as extreme on this issue. Mackenzie supports legislation to reduce abortions through improved maternal healthcare, easier adoption processes, and community support programs. He believes Pennsylvania should enact protections for life from conception, including defunding organizations like Planned Parenthood that promote abortion. In the Pennsylvania House, he backed bills restricting late-term abortions and requiring informed consent. For the 2026 race, Mackenzie pledges to co-sponsor federal bills like the Life at Conception Act and work to overturn Roe v. Wade remnants post-Dobbs. He views abortion as a moral crisis, emphasizing that true compassion involves supporting mothers and alternatives to termination. His position aligns with conservative values, prioritizing family and sanctity of life over government-funded abortions. This stance has earned endorsements from pro-life groups, and he commits to no taxpayer dollars supporting elective abortions. (178 words)",
            "EDUCATION": "Mackenzie champions parental rights in education, arguing parents must know what their children learn in school. He seeks to ban Critical Race Theory (CRT) and age-inappropriate sex/gender ideology from K-12 curricula, promoting merit-based systems over divisive ideologies. As a father of three, he supports the Parentsâ€™ Bill of Rights for transparency in school materials and expanded school choice, including vouchers and charter schools. In the PA House, he advocated for career and technical education (CTE) investments to prepare students for manufacturing jobs in the Lehigh Valley. For federal policy, Mackenzie plans to block federal funding for schools pushing 'woke' agendas and redirect resources to STEM and vocational programs. He opposes federal overreach in local education, favoring state control. His 2026 platform includes auditing Department of Education spending for waste and ensuring no federal mandates on gender ideology. Mackenzie believes education should foster unity and opportunity, not division, and will fight union monopolies hindering reforms. This focus resonates in his district's blue-collar communities. (192 words)",
            "RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM": "Mackenzie is a defender of religious freedom, free speech, and against progressive cancel culture. He opposes federal government collusion with Big Tech and media to censor dissenting voices, including faith-based ones. In Congress, he will support bills protecting religious institutions from discrimination, such as ensuring faith-based adoption agencies aren't forced to violate beliefs. Drawing from his conservative principles, Mackenzie views religious liberty as foundational to America, citing the First Amendment. He criticizes Biden-era policies targeting pro-life protesters and religious schools. For 2026, he pledges to repeal laws infringing on faith expressions in public spaces and protect chaplains in military. As a PA legislator, he backed religious exemption bills for COVID mandates. Mackenzie commits to no federal funding for programs undermining Judeo-Christian values. His stance includes defending churches' tax-exempt status and opposing 'hate speech' laws silencing pastors. This position stems from his belief in limited government preserving individual rights, earning support from faith communities in PA-7. (168 words)",
            "GUNS": "A Second Amendment absolutist, Mackenzie defends the right to bear arms as protection against tyranny. He supports constitutional carry nationwide and opposes red flag laws or confiscations without due process. In the Lehigh Valley, with high crime in urban areas, he argues strict gun control fails, as seen in cities like Philadelphia with rampant violence despite bans. Instead, Mackenzie focuses on root causes: prosecuting criminals, addressing mental health, and combating gangs/drugs. In PA House, he sponsored bills enhancing concealed carry reciprocity. For federal, he will fight ATF overreach and universal background checks infringing on law-abiding citizens. His 2026 campaign highlights defending hunters and self-defense rights for families. Mackenzie signed NRA pledges and believes armed citizens deter crime better than gun-free zones. He opposes assault weapon bans, viewing them as symbolic. This pro-gun stance aligns with rural PA-7 voters, and he vows to block any House bills eroding gun rights. (162 words)",
            "TAXES": "Mackenzie is a fiscal hawk, signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge to oppose tax hikes. He aims to cut federal taxes burdening workers, eliminate wasteful spending fueling inflation, and simplify the code for growth. As PA House member, he reduced state regulations and taxes on businesses. For Congress, he targets IRS expansion, proposing to abolish it for a fairer system. His 2026 platform includes no new taxes, permanent TCJA extensions, and deductions for manufacturing. Mackenzie criticizes Democrat spending sprees causing $35 trillion debt. He supports balanced budgets and line-item veto for presidents. In Lehigh Valley, he focuses on property tax relief via federal grants. Endorsed by Americans for Tax Reform, he believes lower taxes create jobs, not deficits. This position reflects his finance background from NYU and Harvard, emphasizing economic freedom over government largesse. (158 words)",
            "IMMIGRATION": "Mackenzie demands secure borders, finishing the wall, reinstating Remain in Mexico, and mandatory E-Verify to protect PA jobs from illegal immigrants. He opposes sanctuary cities, withholding funds from them, and deporting criminal aliens immediately. Criticizing Biden's open borders as an invasion, he blames fentanyl deaths and wage suppression on lax policies. In PA House, he backed state-level enforcement. For 2026, he pledges merit-based legal immigration, ending chain migration and birthright citizenship abuse. Mackenzie supports English proficiency requirements and opposes amnesty. His district's manufacturing sector suffers from cheap labor competition. He will co-sponsor bills like Secure the Border Act, focusing on national security against cartels and terrorists. This hardline stance appeals to working-class voters, and he commits to no benefits for illegals, prioritizing citizens. (152 words)",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Mackenzie promotes traditional family values, merit, and fairness. As a husband and father, he opposes race-based quotas and protects women's sports from transgender participation. He seeks to ban federal funding for divisive DEI programs, redirecting to family support like child tax credits. In education, parental rights ensure values alignment. For 2026, he fights 'woke' culture eroding family units, supporting paid leave and affordable childcare. In PA, he backed family leave expansions. Mackenzie views strong families as societal bedrock, opposing abortion and promoting adoption. He will defend against Big Tech censorship of family content and ensure military respects family separations. Endorsed by family policy groups, his platform builds communities with infrastructure and value-sharing orgs, no tax dollars to anti-American entities. This resonates in faith-heavy PA-7. (154 words)",
            "ELECTION-INTEGRITY": "Mackenzie prioritizes election integrity: easy to vote, hard to cheat. He supports voter ID, bans on unsecured drop boxes/ballot harvesting, no private money in elections, and non-citizen voting prohibitions. Criticizing 2020 irregularities, he seeks federal standards like paper ballots and audits. In PA House, he pushed signature verification. For 2026 re-election, he vows no Supreme Court packing and term limits. He opposes mail-in expansions without safeguards. His stance includes prosecuting fraud and same-day voting. This builds trust in democracy, appealing to skeptical voters. Mackenzie signed U.S. Term Limits pledge, committing to reforms preventing manipulation. (151 words)"
