        "bio": "Paige Gebhardt Cognetti, born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, has dedicated her career to public service and economic development. She graduated from the University of Oregon with a bachelor's degree in English and later earned an MBA from Harvard Business School. Cognetti's professional journey began in the Obama-Biden administration, where she served as a senior advisor to the Under Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Treasury Department from 2009 to 2012, focusing on global economic policy. Returning to Pennsylvania, she advised the state Auditor General on economic development initiatives and worked in the private sector before launching her political career. In 2019, she made history as the first woman elected mayor of Scranton, sworn in on January 6, 2020, and re-elected to a full term in 2021. As mayor, Cognetti prioritized fiscal responsibility, achieving an investment-grade credit rating for the city and exiting its distressed status after decades. She cut red tape to promote economic growth, lowered permit fees to support small businesses, invested in public safety by hiring more police officers, and advanced infrastructure projects like road repairs and park revitalizations. Her administration also launched initiatives to combat the opioid crisis and support workforce development. Married to Andy Cognetti, a local businessman and former state representative, the couple has two young children and resides in Scranton. Cognetti's congressional campaign focuses on protecting reproductive rights, lowering healthcare and childcare costs, investing in clean energy jobs, and safeguarding democracy from extremism.

            "ABORTION": "Paige Cognetti strongly supports reproductive rights and access to abortion care, viewing it as a fundamental aspect of women's healthcare and personal autonomy. As a Democrat, she advocates for codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law to restore nationwide protections overturned by the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. During her tenure as Scranton mayor, Cognetti championed policies promoting gender equity and healthcare access, including partnerships with local clinics to ensure comprehensive women's health services. She believes government should not interfere in private medical decisions between patients and providers, emphasizing that restrictions disproportionately harm low-income and rural women in districts like PA-8. Cognetti pledges to oppose any federal bans or funding cuts to Planned Parenthood, while pushing for expanded contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Her position aligns with her commitment to family well-being, recognizing that safe, legal abortion prevents dangerous back-alley procedures and allows women to plan their futures. In Congress, she will fight for the Women's Health Protection Act to safeguard these rights, ensuring Pennsylvania women retain control over their bodies amid ongoing state-level threats. This stance reflects her broader belief in equity and justice, drawn from her experiences advising on economic policies that intersect with social determinants of health. (178 words)",
            "EDUCATION": "Education is a cornerstone of opportunity, and Cognetti is committed to fully funding public schools to ensure every child in PA-8 has access to quality education regardless of zip code. As mayor, she invested in early childhood programs and vocational training partnerships with local businesses to prepare Scranton youth for high-demand jobs in manufacturing and energy. She supports increasing federal Title I funding for under-resourced districts and opposes voucher programs that divert money from public schools. Cognetti advocates for universal pre-K, debt-free college through expanded Pell Grants, and loan forgiveness for teachers in high-need areas. Drawing from her Harvard MBA, she emphasizes STEM education and bilingual programs to reflect the district's diverse population. In Congress, she will push for the College for All Act to make public college tuition-free and invest in teacher training to address shortages. Her record includes collaborating with community colleges for workforce development, reducing dropout rates by linking education to economic mobility. Cognetti views education as the great equalizer, essential for combating poverty and fostering innovation in Pennsylvania's industrial heartland. (192 words)",
            "RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM": "Cognetti upholds the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom while protecting the separation of church and state. As mayor, she issued proclamations for interfaith days of mourning during the COVID-19 pandemic, partnering with faith leaders across denominations to support community resilience and equitable vaccine distribution. She believes religious liberty means individuals can practice their faith without government imposition or discrimination, but it does not extend to denying others' rights, such as LGBTQ+ equality or reproductive healthcare. In Congress, she will defend against efforts to erode church-state separation, like funding religious schools with public dollars, and support the Religious Freedom Restoration Act's balanced application. Her inclusive approach, informed by Scranton's diverse religious communities, includes hosting multifaith events to promote dialogue and combat hate. Cognetti opposes using religion to justify policy that harms vulnerable groups, advocating for protections against antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other biases. This commitment stems from her Treasury days advising on global human rights, where she saw faith as a force for good when not politicized. (168 words)",

She opposes assault weapons bans that infringe on lawful use but favors closing the gun show loophole and implementing safe storage requirements to prevent tragedies. In PA-8, where rural and urban areas coexist, her balanced approach includes funding for school safety grants without arming teachers. Cognetti will co-sponsor the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act expansions, investing in violence intervention programs and mental health support. Her firefighter family background informs her view that guns save lives when used properly but devastate when misused by felons or the unstable. She critiques extreme positions on both sides, pushing for evidence-based policies like waiting periods to reduce suicides and mass shootings, ensuring safety for families without punishing law-abiding citizens. (182 words)",
            "TAXES": "Cognetti fights for tax policies that reward work, not wealth, ensuring middle-class families in PA-8 keep more of their earnings. As Scranton mayor, she balanced budgets without raising property taxes, instead cutting fees and attracting investments that boosted local revenues. She supports raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and closing loopholes exploited by billionaires, while expanding the Child Tax Credit to provide direct relief. Opposing Trump's 2017 cuts that exploded the deficit and benefited the top 1%, she backs the Fair Share Act to make the ultra-wealthy pay their due. In Congress, Cognetti will protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, advocating for a billionaire minimum tax to fund infrastructure without burdening workers.

This pro-family stance addresses rising costs, ensuring Pennsylvania's working class thrives in a system rigged against them. (168 words)",

She backs bipartisan border security funding for technology and personnel, without family separations or wall excesses. In PA-8, with its immigrant labor in agriculture and manufacturing, she emphasizes work visas and asylum process efficiency to uphold America's values. Cognetti opposes mass deportations that harm families and businesses, instead focusing on employer accountability for hiring undocumented workers. Drawing from her Treasury role on international finance, she sees immigration as an economic boon when managed fairly. She will champion the U.S. Citizenship Act to integrate long-term residents, boosting GDP and filling labor shortages. Her position balances compassion with law enforcement, rejecting extremism that demonizes newcomers while addressing fentanyl trafficking through targeted resources. (172 words)",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Family values to Cognetti mean supporting policies that allow parents to thrive, from paid family leave to affordable childcare. As a mother of two, she expanded Scranton's family resource centers, providing diapers, counseling, and job training. She supports the FAMILY Act for 12 weeks paid leave and universal childcare subsidies to ease burdens on working parents. In Congress, she will expand the Child Tax Credit to $3,600 per child and protect LGBTQ+ families from discriminatory laws. Cognetti views strong families as the foundation of strong communities, advocating for gun violence prevention and mental health access to keep children safe. Her platform includes housing affordability measures like tax credits for first-time buyers and opposition to corporate rent gouging. Influenced by her single-parent upbringing, she prioritizes equity, ensuring all families—regardless of structure—access quality healthcare and education. This holistic approach counters division, promoting unity and opportunity for Pennsylvania's next generation. (168 words)",
            "ELECTION-INTEGRITY": "Election integrity demands secure, accessible voting without suppression, and Cognetti commits to modernizing systems to restore trust. As mayor, she oversaw fair local elections with expanded early voting and drop boxes, increasing turnout. She supports the For the People Act to standardize voting rights nationwide, combating gerrymandering and dark money. Opposing voter ID laws that disenfranchise minorities, she favors automatic registration and mail-in expansions proven secure in Pennsylvania. In PA-8, she will audit election equipment for vulnerabilities and fund cybersecurity. Cognetti denounces 2020 election lies that eroded faith, pledging transparency through independent oversight. Her Treasury background in financial integrity informs her push for campaign finance reform to limit billionaire influence. By ensuring every eligible vote counts, she upholds democracy's core, fostering participation over partisanship and protecting against foreign interference. (162 words)"

As a father and union leader, Brooks sees this as part of broader family support, ensuring women aren't forced into poverty by unwanted pregnancies. He opposes state triggers post-Dobbs, advocating for the Women's Health Protection Act to guarantee safe, legal care nationwide. In PA-7, with its manufacturing families, he highlights how restrictions exacerbate economic hardships. Brooks' firefighter career exposed him to healthcare crises, reinforcing his belief that bodily autonomy saves lives.

Brooks views extremism in faith politics as divisive, pledging to unite through shared values like compassion and justice. (158 words)",
            "GUNS": "As a gun-owning firefighter from a hunting family, Brooks reveres the Second Amendment but demands accountability to halt child deaths from firearms, now the leading cause.

He backs the Fair Share Act, lifting Social Security caps and hiking investment taxes modestly.

In PA-7, families face rising costs; his policies protect Social Security, ensuring retirement dignity. Brooks views strong unions as family bedrock, delivering pensions and bargaining.

No stock trading for Congress, ending insider deals like Trump's Qatar jet. As a January 6 witness, he demands accountability, auditing machines and funding cybersecurity.
