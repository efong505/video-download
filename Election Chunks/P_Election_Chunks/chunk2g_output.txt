            "ABORTION": "As a judge, I uphold the law as it stands, including Pennsylvania's protections for reproductive rights under the state constitution. My rulings have consistently supported access to healthcare without undue interference, recognizing the fundamental right to privacy in medical decisions. In cases involving reproductive health, I prioritize evidence-based outcomes that respect individual autonomy while ensuring public safety. The Commonwealth Court plays a crucial role in reviewing administrative actions that impact healthcare access, and I am committed to fair adjudication that prevents discriminatory barriers to abortion services. This approach aligns with judicial neutrality, focusing on legal precedents like those established in landmark state cases. (152 words)",
            "EDUCATION": "Education funding equity is paramount, as evidenced by recent Supreme Court rulings declaring Pennsylvania's system unconstitutional. On the Commonwealth Court, I would scrutinize appeals involving state aid distribution to ensure compliance with adequacy standards. My experience in family court has shown me the direct impact of underfunded schools on vulnerable children, from special education to mental health support. I advocate for increased investment in public education, including vocational programs and teacher retention initiatives. Judicially, this means upholding statutes that promote fair resource allocation across districts, preventing urban-rural disparities. Pennsylvania must prioritize K-12 funding to foster opportunity, and I will defend policies that advance evidence-based reforms like universal pre-K and curriculum modernization. (158 words)",
            "RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM": "Religious freedom is a cornerstone of our democracy, and as a judge, I balance it against competing rights without bias. In Commonwealth Court cases involving faith-based exemptions in state regulations, I apply strict scrutiny to ensure protections under the First Amendment and Pennsylvania's Religious Freedom Protection Act.

For instance, in disputes over school policies or employment accommodations, I weigh evidence to prevent discrimination.

(154 words)",
            "GUNS": "Gun rights and safety intersect in administrative law, where Commonwealth Court reviews licensing and regulatory challenges. I support Second Amendment protections while endorsing reasonable measures like universal background checks to curb violence.

            "TAXES": "Fiscal policy affects every Pennsylvanian, and on Commonwealth Court, I review tax disputes involving state agencies. I favor fair, progressive taxation that funds essential services without overburdening working families. My civil litigation background includes tax equity cases, highlighting the need for transparent assessments and appeals processes. Pennsylvania's reliance on property taxes for education strains locals; I support shifting to broader-based revenue like closing corporate loopholes. Judicially, this means enforcing statutes that prevent arbitrary impositions and ensure compliance with uniformity clauses. Sustainable budgets require balanced approaches, and I will adjudicate to promote economic justice and growth. (153 words)",
            "IMMIGRATION": "Immigration cases often reach Commonwealth Court through administrative reviews, and I am dedicated to humane, lawful enforcement. As an immigrant myself, I advocate for due process in deportation challenges and benefit adjudications. Pennsylvania's sanctuary policies merit protection against federal overreach, ensuring state resources focus on integration. My bar association work advanced immigrant rights, emphasizing access to counsel and family unity. I would uphold statutes providing in-state tuition for Dreamers and workforce protections. Judicial review must prioritize evidence, rejecting bias in agency decisions. This fosters inclusive communities, boosting economic contributions from diverse populations. (150 words)",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Strong families are the bedrock of society, and my family court experience reinforces policies supporting parental rights and child welfare. On Commonwealth Court, I handle appeals in adoption, custody, and support matters, prioritizing best-interest standards. I support flexible work laws for caregivers and oppose measures eroding traditional family structures. Pennsylvania's values include protecting marriage equality and anti-discrimination protections.
