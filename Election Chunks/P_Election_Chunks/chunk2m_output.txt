She graduated from Stanford University in 1989 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and later earned an M.B.A. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management in 1992. Her military service included commissioning as a second lieutenant in the Air Force, where she served as a civil engineering officer, deploying to Turkey during Operation Provide Comfort to support Kurdish refugees after the Gulf War. After leaving active duty, she continued in the Air Force Reserves until 2016. Houlahan's civilian career focused on manufacturing and technology; she co-founded Andrus Peat, LLC, a manufacturing consulting firm, and served as Chief Operating Officer at CMI Management Services, a defense contractor. She is married to retired Air Force Col. Scot Houlahan, and they have two children. As a moderate Democrat, Houlahan's campaign emphasizes bipartisan solutions on infrastructure, veterans' affairs, economic development, and national security. She supports the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which she helped pass, bringing federal funds to improve roads and broadband in her district spanning Berks, Chester, and Montgomery counties. Houlahan has prioritized mental health resources for veterans and small business support post-COVID. In 2024, she won re-election with 58% of the vote against Republican Ryan MacKenzie.

            "ABORTION": "As a Democrat and former Air Force officer, Chrissy Houlahan staunchly supports reproductive rights, viewing access to abortion as essential healthcare. She cosponsored the Women's Health Protection Act to codify Roe v. Wade protections federally, arguing that restrictions endanger women's lives and autonomy. In her district, where diverse communities rely on Planned Parenthood services, Houlahan has fought against defunding efforts, emphasizing that Pennsylvania's state-level protections must be bolstered amid national threats. She believes bodily autonomy is a fundamental right, drawing from her engineering background to advocate for evidence-based policies over ideological bans. Houlahan has shared personal stories from constituents affected by travel bans and delays, highlighting economic burdens on families. Her stance aligns with Democratic leadership, but she seeks bipartisan dialogue on maternal health to reduce abortion needs through better contraception access and sex education. In 2024 debates, she criticized Republican opponents for supporting a national ban, vowing to protect Title X funding for family planning. Houlahan's position reflects her commitment to women's equality, ensuring no one is forced into unsafe procedures or denied care due to geography or income. She supports exceptions for rape, incest, and life-threatening cases, while pushing for comprehensive healthcare reform to address root causes like poverty and lack of support systems. This multifaceted approach aims to lower unintended pregnancies and empower women in Pennsylvania's suburban and rural areas.",
            "EDUCATION": "Houlahan prioritizes accessible, high-quality public education as key to economic mobility. She secured $1.5 million in federal grants for career-technical education in her district's schools, focusing on STEM programs to prepare students for manufacturing jobs. As a mother and veteran, she advocates for increased Title I funding for low-income schools and universal pre-K, arguing Pennsylvania's underfunding crisis—ranked 47th nationally—hampers competitiveness. Houlahan supports the College for All Act to eliminate tuition at public colleges and expand Pell Grants, while opposing voucher programs that divert funds from public institutions. In Congress, she introduced the Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act to integrate vocational training in supply chain management. She addresses teacher shortages by backing loan forgiveness and mental health support, drawing from district feedback on post-pandemic recovery. Houlahan champions equity, ensuring ESL programs for immigrant families and special education compliance. Her bipartisan work on the Problem Solvers Caucus includes infrastructure bills funding school repairs. Locally, she partners with Chester County schools for broadband expansion to close digital divides. This holistic strategy invests in early childhood through workforce development, fostering innovation in Pennsylvania's knowledge economy.",
            "RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM": "Houlahan defends religious freedom as a cornerstone of democracy, supporting the First Amendment while opposing government imposition of beliefs. She cosponsored the Do No Harm Act to prevent religious exemptions from discriminating against LGBTQ+ individuals in healthcare and adoption. As a moderate, she engages faith communities on shared values like compassion and service, hosting interfaith dialogues in her district. Houlahan opposes using religion to justify policy, such as in abortion restrictions, and voted against the Respect for Marriage Act's opponents. She advocates for protections against antisemitism and Islamophobia, securing funding for security at Jewish and Muslim centers post-2023 rises in hate crimes. Her military experience informs her view that pluralism strengthens national security. Houlahan supports chaplains in schools but ensures no proselytizing, balancing accommodation with separation of church and state. In Pennsylvania, she addresses tensions in diverse Montgomery County by promoting inclusive civics education. This balanced approach safeguards minority faiths without privileging any, fostering unity in a pluralistic society.",
            "GUNS": "A gun owner and hunter's spouse, Houlahan supports Second Amendment rights alongside commonsense reforms. She backs universal background checks, red-flag laws, and assault weapons bans, citing her Air Force service where firearm safety was paramount. After Parkland, she joined the Problem Solvers Caucus to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, funding mental health and school safety. Houlahan opposes teacher arming, arguing trained professionals suffice, and supports closing the boyfriend loophole for domestic abusers. In her district, she listens to NRA members and survivors, advocating safe storage laws to prevent suicides—Pennsylvania's leading gun death cause. She introduced the Firearm Safety Act for education grants. Her position bridges divides, protecting lawful owners while reducing mass shootings, as seen in her 2024 primary unity.",
            "TAXES": "Houlahan favors fair taxation to fund infrastructure without burdening middle-class families. She supports raising corporate rates to 28% and closing loopholes for billionaires, while extending TCJA credits for low-income workers. As COO of a small business, she knows deductions spur growth; she backs R&D tax credits and opposes flat taxes. In Congress, she voted for the Inflation Reduction Act's IRS modernization to audit wealthy evaders, projecting $200 billion revenue. For Pennsylvania, she pushes property tax relief via federal education grants, easing local burdens. Houlahan critiques GOP cuts favoring the rich, advocating progressive reforms to invest in green jobs and childcare, boosting GDP. This pro-growth stance ensures fiscal responsibility amid deficits.",
            "IMMIGRATION": "Houlahan seeks comprehensive reform with border security and pathways to citizenship. She supports DREAMers, cosponsoring the Dream Act, and opposes family separations. As a veteran, she values immigrants' military service, advocating visa expansions for skilled workers in Pennsylvania's tech sector. She backs bipartisan border tech funding but rejects wall-only approaches. Houlahan addresses asylum backlogs and employer verification, protecting jobs while aiding refugees. In her district, she aids Ukrainian and Afghan evacuees, securing resettlement funds. Her plan includes English classes and work authorizations to integrate newcomers economically.",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Houlahan champions family-supportive policies like paid leave and affordable childcare. She cosponsored the FAMILY Act for 12 weeks paid leave and the Child Care for Working Families Act to cap costs at 7% income. As a working mother, she understands balancing careers and parenting, pushing expanded child tax credits that cut child poverty 30%. She supports LGBTQ+ equality, including marriage and adoption rights, viewing diverse families as societal strengths. Houlahan addresses opioid impacts on families via treatment funding and opposes cuts to SNAP/WIC. In Pennsylvania, she funds rural childcare deserts, promoting family stability through economic security.",
            "ELECTION-INTEGRITY": "Houlahan upholds election integrity through secure, accessible voting. She supports the For the People Act for automatic registration and early voting, countering voter suppression. As a moderate, she backs paper ballots and audits but opposes unfounded fraud claims eroding trust. In 2024, she defended Pennsylvania's processes amid challenges, funding cybersecurity. Houlahan advocates bipartisan commissions for redistricting fairness, ensuring every vote counts without partisanship."
