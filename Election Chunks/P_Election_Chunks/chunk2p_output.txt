        "bio": "Brian Fitzpatrick, born on December 28, 1963, in Levittown, Pennsylvania, is a Republican serving as the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District since 2017. A moderate Republican, Fitzpatrick previously worked as a special agent for the FBI from 1993 to 2005, where he investigated organized crime and corruption cases. He later founded his own law firm, focusing on civil litigation. Fitzpatrick holds a Bachelor of Arts from La Salle University and a Juris Doctor from Dickinson School of Law. Married to Chandel, he has three children and resides in Middletown Township, Bucks County. His family has deep roots in public service; his late brother, Mike Fitzpatrick, served as a U.S. Representative for the same district from 2005 to 2017. In Congress, Fitzpatrick has prioritized bipartisan efforts, co-chairing the Bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and advocating for national security, economic growth, and healthcare reform. He has been ranked as one of the most bipartisan members of Congress by the Lugar Center and Georgetown University. During his tenure, he has secured over $100 million in federal funding for local infrastructure projects in Bucks and Montgomery counties. Fitzpatrick's campaign for re-election in 2026 emphasizes protecting Social Security, lowering prescription drug costs, and supporting law enforcement. He voted against certain Trump administration policies, such as the Big Beautiful Bill Act, drawing criticism from some conservatives but praise from independents.

        "positions": {
            "ABORTION": "Congressman Fitzpatrick maintains a complex stance on abortion, rooted in his Catholic faith and commitment to reducing unwanted pregnancies. He supports exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother, and has voted for legislation that provides access to contraception and family planning services to prevent abortions. In 2022, he co-sponsored the Women's Health Protection Act, which aimed to codify Roe v. Wade protections, though he later opposed broader expansions. Fitzpatrick believes that government should focus on supporting women through paid family leave, affordable childcare, and economic opportunities rather than restrictive bans. He has stated, 'I am pro-life, but I recognize that criminalizing women does not align with compassionate conservatism.' His position has drawn fire from both pro-life advocates, who see it as insufficiently stringent, and pro-choice groups, who criticize his reluctance to fully endorse abortion rights up to viability. In the context of Pennsylvania's battleground status, Fitzpatrick navigates this by emphasizing local control and moral persuasion over federal mandates. He supports funding for crisis pregnancy centers and adoption services as alternatives. This nuanced approach reflects his bipartisan ethos, aiming to bridge divides by promoting policies that lower abortion rates through social support systems. Overall, his record shows a willingness to work across aisles on reproductive health, evidenced by his support for the Right to Contraception Act in 2024. (178 words)",
            "EDUCATION": "Fitzpatrick is a staunch advocate for bolstering public education funding and school choice options in Pennsylvania's suburban districts. He has secured over $50 million in federal grants for STEM programs and teacher training in PA-01 schools. As a former FBI agent, he prioritizes school safety, co-authoring the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022, which funded mental health counselors and threat assessment teams. He opposes blanket voucher programs that divert funds from public schools but supports targeted scholarships for low-income students in underperforming districts. Fitzpatrick's campaign highlights vocational training and apprenticeship programs to prepare students for high-demand jobs in manufacturing and technology sectors prevalent in Bucks County. He has criticized federal overreach in curriculum standards, advocating for local control while pushing for universal pre-K access. In 2025, he introduced legislation to expand broadband in rural and suburban schools to close the digital divide exacerbated by the pandemic. His approach balances fiscal conservatism with investment in human capital, emphasizing accountability measures like performance-based funding. Fitzpatrick's personal connection—his children attended public schools—drives his focus on reducing class sizes and supporting special education under IDEA. He has earned endorsements from teachers' unions for his pragmatic reforms. (192 words)",
            "RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM": "A committed defender of religious liberty, Fitzpatrick has consistently voted to protect faith-based organizations from government overreach. As a Catholic, he led efforts to safeguard conscience protections for healthcare providers under the Affordable Care Act. In 2023, he co-sponsored the Do No Harm Act to prevent federal funds from supporting procedures violating religious beliefs. He opposes mandates that force religious institutions to violate doctrines, such as on LGBTQ+ accommodations, while supporting anti-discrimination laws that respect exemptions. Fitzpatrick's bipartisan work includes the 2024 Religious Liberty and Conscience Protection Act, ensuring faith groups can operate summer camps and adoption agencies without undue burden. He views religious freedom as foundational to American pluralism, stating, 'Faith communities are the bedrock of our civil society.' In Pennsylvania, he has advocated for synagogue and mosque security grants amid rising antisemitism and Islamophobia. His record includes opposing the Equality Act without religious carve-outs and supporting the First Amendment Defense Act. Fitzpatrick bridges divides by partnering with Democrats on interfaith dialogues and hate crime prevention. This stance aligns with his moderate Republicanism, prioritizing dialogue over confrontation in a diverse district. (185 words)",
            "GUNS": "Fitzpatrick supports Second Amendment rights while endorsing commonsense reforms post-mass shootings. He earned an A rating from the NRA but voted for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022, expanding background checks for under-21 buyers and funding red-flag laws. In PA-01, with its mix of suburban hunters and urban families, he backs universal background checks and closing the gun show loophole without banning assault weapons. Fitzpatrick opposes red-flag laws that infringe on due process but supports state-level implementations with safeguards. He has introduced bills for armed school resource officers and mental health screenings for firearm purchases. 'Responsible gun ownership is a cornerstone of our freedoms, but we must prevent tragedies,' he stated after the 2024 Bucks County incident. His campaign emphasizes cracking down on straw purchases and trafficking from neighboring states. As a former FBI agent, he prioritizes prosecuting illegal gun crimes over new restrictions. This balanced approach has garnered support from both Giffords and NRA moderates, reflecting his district's divided views. (172 words)",
            "TAXES": "A fiscal conservative, Fitzpatrick advocates for tax relief to stimulate economic growth in Pennsylvania's 1st District. He voted for the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, crediting it with creating 5,000 jobs in Bucks County. For 2026, he proposes extending TCJA provisions for middle-class families, including doubling the child tax credit to $3,600. Fitzpatrick opposes raising the corporate rate above 21% but supports closing loopholes for multinational firms. He has fought for property tax caps in suburban areas burdened by school funding inequities. In Congress, he co-chairs the Bipartisan Budget Group, securing deals that avoid shutdowns while trimming waste. His plan includes eliminating the SALT deduction cap for PA residents, arguing it unfairly penalizes high-tax states. Fitzpatrick emphasizes infrastructure investments funded by user fees, not general revenue. 'Lower taxes mean more money in Pennsylvanians' pockets for families and small businesses,' he says. Endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, his record shows consistent votes against tax hikes, balancing revenue needs with relief for seniors on fixed incomes. (168 words)",
            "IMMIGRATION": "Fitzpatrick supports comprehensive immigration reform with strong border security. He backs legal pathways for Dreamers and farmworkers while calling for 700 miles of border wall completion. In 2024, he voted for the bipartisan border bill that added 1,500 agents and asylum reforms, criticizing its failure as a 'missed opportunity.' For PA-01's diverse communities, he prioritizes E-Verify mandates for employers and expedited removals for criminals. Fitzpatrick opposes sanctuary policies, advocating federal grants conditioned on cooperation. He has secured funding for ICE operations in Philadelphia suburbs. His plan includes merit-based visas to attract tech talent to Pennsylvania's innovation hubs. As co-chair of the Congressional Problem Solvers, he pushes for DACA codification tied to border tech investments. 'Secure borders and humane policies go hand-in-hand,' he asserts. This stance appeals to his district's independents, blending enforcement with compassion for long-term residents. (162 words)",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Deeply committed to family values, Fitzpatrick champions policies supporting working parents and traditional institutions. He co-sponsored the FAMILY Act for paid family leave, allowing 12 weeks for new parents or caregivers. As a father of three, he prioritizes child welfare, voting to increase adoption tax credits and child care subsidies. Fitzpatrick opposes same-sex marriage federally but defers to states, focusing instead on religious exemptions. He supports school choice to empower parental rights in education. In 2025, he introduced the Strengthening Families Act, funding marriage counseling and youth mentorship programs. 'Strong families build strong communities,' he often says. His Catholic faith informs advocacy for anti-trafficking laws and opioid recovery for families. In Bucks County, he has hosted family resource fairs. This holistic approach emphasizes economic stability, mental health access, and moral education without imposing views. Endorsed by Focus on the Family, his record reflects bipartisan efforts to reduce child poverty by 50% through the 2021 child tax credit expansion. (178 words)",
            "ELECTION-INTEGRITY": "Fitzpatrick is a vocal proponent of election security, co-sponsoring the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 to clarify certification processes and prevent disruptions. He supports voter ID requirements balanced with expanded access like same-day registration. In Pennsylvania, he has pushed for paper ballots and post-election audits, criticizing 2020 irregularities without endorsing fraud claims. As a former FBI agent, he advocates federal standards for cybersecurity in voting machines. His 2026 platform includes funding for risk-limiting audits and bipartisan observer programs. 'Trust in our democracy demands transparency and accountability,' he states. Fitzpatrick opposed January 6 commission limits but backs prosecutions. In PA-01, he hosted town halls on voting rights. This measured stance has earned praise from the Brennan Center and Heritage Foundation alike, positioning him as a bridge-builder in polarized times. (152 words)"
