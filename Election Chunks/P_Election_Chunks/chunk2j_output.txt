        "bio": "Brian Fitzpatrick, born on December 28, 1973, in Levittown, Pennsylvania, is a seasoned attorney and former FBI agent serving as the incumbent U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District since 2017. A graduate of La Salle University with a bachelor's in psychology and Villanova University School of Law, Fitzpatrick earned his Juris Doctor in 2006. Prior to his congressional tenure, he spent a decade as a special agent with the FBI, specializing in counterterrorism and cybercrime investigations, and later founded his own law firm focusing on white-collar defense. As a moderate Republican, Fitzpatrick has built a reputation for bipartisanship, co-chairing the Bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and authoring legislation on issues like opioid crisis response and veteran affairs. He is a husband and father of three, residing in Middletown Township, Bucks County, where he coaches youth sports and serves on local community boards. His campaign emphasizes protecting Social Security, investing in infrastructure, and combating inflation through targeted tax relief, drawing on his law enforcement background to advocate for stronger national security measures. Fitzpatrick's reelection bid in 2026 faces challenges from Democrats amid shifting district dynamics, but his track record of crossing party lines, including votes to impeach former President Trump, underscores his commitment to pragmatic governance.

        "faith_statement": "As a lifelong Catholic, I am guided by the principles of faith, family, and service to others, drawing inspiration from Pope Francis's call to care for the least among us in my public service.",
        "website": "https://fitzpatrick.house.gov/",
        "positions": {
            "ABORTION": "Congressman Fitzpatrick maintains a nuanced stance on abortion, shaped by his Catholic faith and commitment to reducing unwanted pregnancies through comprehensive support systems. While personally opposed to abortion, he supports exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and life-threatening situations for the mother, emphasizing that government should not impose one-size-fits-all policies but instead focus on preventive measures like expanded access to contraception, maternal healthcare, and adoption incentives. In Congress, he has voted against extreme federal abortion bans that lack these exceptions and opposed defunding Planned Parenthood for its non-abortion services, arguing that such actions harm women's health overall. Fitzpatrick advocates for state-level decision-making post-Roe v. Wade overturn, believing Pennsylvania's laws provide balanced protections. He has introduced bills to bolster family planning resources in underserved communities, aiming to lower abortion rates by addressing root causes like poverty and lack of education. Critics from the right accuse him of being too moderate, but he counters that true pro-life advocacy extends beyond bans to holistic support for mothers and children, including paid family leave and child tax credits. This approach, he argues, respects individual conscience while promoting a culture of life. His position reflects a blend of moral conviction and practical governance, prioritizing dialogue over division in a polarized nation.",
            "EDUCATION": "Fitzpatrick is a staunch advocate for education as the cornerstone of opportunity, pushing for increased federal funding for K-12 schools, particularly in STEM and vocational training to prepare students for high-demand jobs. He supports the Every Student Succeeds Act's flexibility for states while ensuring accountability through transparent performance metrics. As a father of school-aged children, he prioritizes school safety, sponsoring the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that funds mental health counselors and threat assessment teams in schools. On higher education, Fitzpatrick backs debt relief for public servants and expansions to Pell Grants, viewing them as investments in workforce development. He opposes blanket student loan forgiveness but favors income-driven repayment plans and incentives for teachers in low-income areas. In Pennsylvania's 1st District, he has secured millions for local schools to modernize facilities and integrate technology, emphasizing equity for suburban and rural students alike. Fitzpatrick critiques overreliance on standardized testing, advocating for holistic assessments that nurture creativity and critical thinking. His vision includes universal pre-K access and partnerships with community colleges for seamless transitions, ensuring no child is left behind regardless of zip code. This comprehensive strategy aims to elevate Pennsylvania's education rankings and foster economic mobility for future generations.",
            "RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM": "Fitzpatrick champions religious freedom as a foundational American value, defending the rights of all faiths to practice openly without government infringement. As co-chair of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, he has led efforts to protect houses of worship from vandalism through enhanced federal prosecutions and funding for security grants. He opposes mandates that force religious institutions to violate their doctrines, such as in healthcare or employment, and supported the Religious Freedom Restoration Act's applications in recent Supreme Court cases. In a diverse district, Fitzpatrick promotes interfaith dialogue, hosting annual summits that bring together Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and other leaders to combat hate crimes. He voted against the Equality Act in its original form due to concerns over religious exemptions but worked on amendments to balance LGBTQ+ protections with faith-based conscience rights. Fitzpatrick's Catholic background informs his belief that true pluralism requires safeguarding minority faiths, including recent pushes to aid persecuted Christians abroad via foreign aid allocations. He criticizes extremism on both sides, from secular overreach to theocratic impositions, advocating for policies that uphold the First Amendment's dual protections. This balanced defense ensures religious liberty thrives as a unifying force, not a divisive one, in Pennsylvania's multicultural fabric.",
            "GUNS": "A former FBI agent, Fitzpatrick approaches gun policy with a law enforcement perspective, supporting Second Amendment rights while prioritizing public safety through universal background checks and red-flag laws. He co-authored the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, requiring checks for all sales to close loopholes exploited by prohibited persons. Fitzpatrick backs banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, citing their role in mass shootings, but opposes outright confiscation, emphasizing mental health interventions and school safety grants instead. In Pennsylvania, he has funded programs to curb gun trafficking across state lines, particularly from urban Philadelphia to suburban Bucks County. As a hunter and NRA-rated supporter with an 'A' in past cycles, he defends concealed carry reciprocity and hunter education funding. However, post-Parkland and Uvalde, he shifted toward commonsense reforms, earning endorsements from Giffords while facing NRA criticism. Fitzpatrick argues that responsible ownership is key, promoting safe storage laws and youth training without infringing on lawful use. His record includes over 20 gun violence prevention bills, blending enforcement with prevention to reduce tragedies without alienating sportsmen. This pragmatic stance seeks to bridge divides, saving lives through evidence-based measures tailored to Pennsylvania's gun-owning culture.",
            "TAXES": "Fitzpatrick advocates for fiscally responsible tax policies that reward work and investment without burdening middle-class families. He supports extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions for individuals, like doubled child tax credits and standard deductions, which he credits with spurring economic growth in Pennsylvania's 1st District. As a deficit hawk, he pushes for closing corporate loopholes and eliminating wasteful spending to offset cuts, opposing new taxes on Social Security benefits. Fitzpatrick has introduced bills to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, targeting service and manufacturing workers prevalent in Bucks and Montgomery counties. He critiques inflationary spending, voting against omnibus bills exceeding $1.7 trillion, and favors dynamic scoring to measure tax cuts' revenue impacts. In Congress, he co-chairs the Bipartisan Fiscal Caucus, negotiating balanced budgets that protect small businesses via R&D credits and opportunity zones. Fitzpatrick opposes a national sales tax or VAT, preferring consumption-based reforms at the state level. His approach emphasizes fairness—higher contributions from the ultra-wealthy through IRS enforcement—while fostering job creation. This pro-growth, anti-waste strategy aims to keep Pennsylvania competitive, ensuring families retain more earnings for education, healthcare, and retirement security.",
            "IMMIGRATION": "Fitzpatrick supports comprehensive immigration reform that secures borders while providing pathways to citizenship for Dreamers and essential workers. Drawing from his FBI experience in counterterrorism, he backs increased funding for border technology, personnel, and fentanyl interdiction, criticizing sanctuary policies that hinder federal-local cooperation. He co-sponsored the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, legalizing agricultural labor to address shortages in Pennsylvania's farming communities. Fitzpatrick opposes amnesty without enforcement, advocating E-Verify mandates and asylum reforms to expedite claims and deter abuse. In response to migrant surges, he has called for ending catch-and-release and expanding detention capacity. As a moderate, he protects DACA recipients, viewing them as American assets, and supports family reunification visas. Locally, he addresses immigrant integration through English classes and job training funded via community block grants. Fitzpatrick faults both parties for inaction, urging bipartisan deals like his Bipartisan Border Solutions Caucus initiatives. His plan balances compassion with control, enhancing legal immigration to boost the economy while cracking down on trafficking and overstays, ensuring Pennsylvania's immigrant contributions enrich the state without straining resources.",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Deeply committed to family values, Fitzpatrick views strong families as society's bedrock, advocating policies that support parents, protect children, and promote work-life balance. As a father of three, he champions paid family and medical leave, introducing the FAMILY Act to provide up to 12 weeks without wage loss, addressing Pennsylvania's high childcare costs. He supports school choice vouchers for faith-based education while ensuring public schools remain inclusive, opposing indoctrination in curricula. Fitzpatrick backs adoption tax credits and foster care reforms, drawing from personal volunteerism with local shelters. On marriage, he upholds traditional definitions but protects religious freedoms against mandates. He fights opioid epidemics ravaging families, funding treatment via the SUPPORT Act and naloxone distribution. In Congress, Fitzpatrick promotes economic policies like child tax credits to reduce child poverty, emphasizing two-parent households through marriage incentives. He critiques cultural shifts eroding family time, pushing remote work expansions and eldercare support. This holistic agenda fosters stable homes, valuing parental rights in education and healthcare decisions, ensuring Pennsylvania families thrive amid modern challenges like inflation and mental health crises.",
            "ELECTION-INTEGRITY": "Fitzpatrick is a vocal defender of election integrity, emphasizing secure, accessible voting to uphold democracy without unfounded fraud claims. As a former FBI agent, he supports modernizing voting systems with paper ballots, auditable trails, and federal cybersecurity grants to protect against foreign interference. He co-sponsored the Electoral Count Reform Act, clarifying certification processes post-January 6, and backs the For the People Act's provisions for automatic registration and same-day voting. In Pennsylvania, he advocates risk-limiting audits and early processing of mail ballots to build trust. Fitzpatrick opposes voter ID laws he deems suppressive but favors voluntary IDs with alternatives for accessibility. He has condemned election denialism, urging bipartisan commissions to study 2020 irregularities transparently. His legislation includes penalties for voter intimidation and deepfake election ads. Balancing security with inclusion, Fitzpatrick ensures military and overseas ballots are counted promptly. This evidence-based approach aims to restore confidence, rejecting partisanship that erodes faith in institutions, positioning Pennsylvania as a model for fair elections."
