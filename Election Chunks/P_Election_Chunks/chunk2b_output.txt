        "status": "active",
        "bio": "Stacy Garrity is a decorated combat veteran, business leader, and current Pennsylvania State Treasurer running for Governor in 2026. Born in Pennsylvania, she graduated from Sayre High School in Bradford County and earned a B.A. in finance and economics from Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, along with a certification from the Cornell University Business Management Institute. Garrity's military career spanned over 30 years in the U.S. Army Reserve, including deployments in Operation Desert Storm (1991), Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003), and Operation Enduring Freedom (2008). She retired as a colonel, earning two Bronze Stars and a Legion of Merit. During her time at Camp Bucca in Iraq, she was known as the 'Angel of the Desert' for her compassionate leadership in managing a detention facility without any abuse complaints. In the private sector, Garrity worked as a cost accountant and rose to vice president at Global Tungsten & Powders Corp., becoming one of the company's first female vice presidents. She has served on the board of the Bradford County United Way and as a trustee for the Guthrie Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre. Politically, Garrity unsuccessfully ran for U.S. House in Pennsylvania's 12th District in 2019. She was elected State Treasurer in 2020, defeating incumbent Democrat Joe Torsella, and reelected in 2024 with a record number of votes. As Treasurer, she has returned record amounts of unclaimed property ($274 million in FY2023), improved the state's 529 college savings program, divested from China and Russia, and opposed ESG initiatives. Married to Daniel Gizzi, Garrity is a Christian attending Christian Life Church. Her campaign focuses on fiscal responsibility, veteran support, and economic growth, positioning herself as an underdog ready to challenge incumbent Gov. Josh Shapiro.

            "ABORTION": "Stacy Garrity has recently pivoted from her previously staunch anti-abortion stance to a more moderate position in her 2026 gubernatorial campaign, reflecting a strategic shift to appeal to a broader Pennsylvania electorate. Previously, as a Republican Treasurer, she celebrated the overturning of Roe v. Wade and supported restrictions on reproductive rights. However, in September 2025, Garrity signaled a change, stating she would not support a statewide abortion ban and would uphold Pennsylvania's current laws allowing abortions up to 24 weeks with exceptions for the mother's health. She emphasized protecting 'life at all stages' while acknowledging the need for compassion and access to healthcare. This evolution has drawn criticism from anti-abortion advocates but praise from moderates. Garrity's platform now focuses on supporting families through economic policies rather than legislative bans, promising to oppose federal overreach on the issue. She has committed to vetoing any bill that imposes a total ban, prioritizing women's health and autonomy in consultation with medical professionals. This position aligns with Pennsylvania's voter-approved protections and aims to bridge divides in a swing state where abortion rights remain a key issue post-Dobbs. Garrity's campaign highlights her military service and business background as grounding her in practical, non-ideological governance on sensitive topics like reproductive rights. (178 words)",
            "EDUCATION": "Garrity's education platform emphasizes school choice, parental rights, and fiscal accountability to improve outcomes for Pennsylvania students. Drawing from her experience upgrading the state's 529 college savings program, she pledges to expand access to savings accounts for K-12 education expenses, making higher education more affordable. As Governor, she would advocate for increased funding for vocational and technical training programs to prepare students for high-demand jobs in manufacturing and energy sectors. Garrity opposes 'woke' curricula, promising to ban critical race theory and gender ideology in public schools, instead focusing on core subjects like math, reading, and civics. She supports charter schools and vouchers for low-income families, arguing that competition drives innovation. Her plan includes performance-based funding for districts, rewarding those that improve graduation rates and test scores. Garrity also commits to recruiting and retaining teachers through merit pay and professional development, while addressing bullying and mental health with faith-based community partnerships. As a veteran, she prioritizes STEM education to build the next generation of innovators. This comprehensive approach aims to close achievement gaps, particularly in rural areas like her home Bradford County, ensuring every child has access to quality education regardless of zip code. (192 words)",
            "RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM": "Garrity is a strong defender of religious freedom, rooted in her Christian faith and military service where she protected constitutional rights abroad. Her platform vows to protect houses of worship from vandalism and ensure faith-based organizations can operate without government interference. She opposes mandates that force religious institutions to violate their beliefs, such as on LGBTQ+ issues or vaccine policies. As Governor, Garrity would enact legislation shielding pastors and religious schools from discrimination lawsuits and support tax exemptions for faith charities. She criticizes 'cancel culture' targeting believers and promises to defend the First Amendment in public spaces, including prayer in schools and religious displays. Drawing from her opposition to ESG investing that penalizes faith-aligned companies, she would divest state funds from entities discriminating against religious groups. Garrity's vision includes partnerships with faith communities for social services like adoption and addiction recovery, fostering a 'big tent' where diverse faiths contribute to Pennsylvania's moral fabric. Her commitment extends to veterans' faith support in state programs, ensuring religious liberty for all Pennsylvanians in a pluralistic society. (168 words)",
            "GUNS": "A Second Amendment advocate, Garrity supports the right to bear arms as essential for self-defense, hunting, and sport, informed by her military background. She opposes red flag laws and assault weapon bans, arguing they infringe on law-abiding citizens' rights without reducing crime. Instead, her platform focuses on enforcing existing laws, enhancing mental health services, and securing schools to prevent mass shootings. Garrity pledges to veto any new gun control measures and expand concealed carry reciprocity across states. She supports training programs for safe gun ownership and opposes using state funds for gun buybacks. As Governor, she would protect Pennsylvania's strong hunting heritage by opposing urban-led restrictions on firearms. Her position aligns with NRA principles, emphasizing that 'guns don't kill people; criminals do.' Garrity's campaign highlights rural Pennsylvania's reliance on guns for protection and tradition, promising to fight federal overreach like ATF regulations. This pro-gun stance aims to mobilize conservative voters while addressing urban concerns through community policing. (162 words)",
            "TAXES": "Garrity's fiscal conservative platform centers on tax relief to spur economic growth, declaring 'no new taxes' under her governorship. As Treasurer, she has criticized Gov. Shapiro's budgets for excessive spending and vows to cut the corporate net income tax to 4.99% and eliminate property taxes for seniors. She proposes a flat income tax rate to simplify the code and attract businesses, funded by auditing welfare fraud and closing corporate loopholes. Garrity opposes gas tax hikes and promises to return surplus revenues via rebates. Her plan includes property tax caps tied to inflation and incentives for small businesses. Drawing from her business experience, she argues high taxes drive jobs out of Pennsylvania, pledging to make the state a low-tax haven like Texas. This approach aims to boost take-home pay for working families, reduce government waste, and invest savings in infrastructure without borrowing. Garrity's transparency portal experience will ensure accountable budgeting, positioning her as a guardian of taxpayers' dollars. (172 words)",
            "IMMIGRATION": "Garrity advocates for secure borders and legal immigration, criticizing federal policies for burdening Pennsylvania resources. She supports completing the southern border wall, increasing ICE funding, and ending sanctuary cities in the state. As Governor, she would require E-Verify for state contractors and deny benefits to illegal immigrants, prioritizing citizens. Garrity pledges to deploy National Guard for border support and oppose driver's licenses for undocumented individuals. Her platform includes deporting criminal aliens and reforming asylum laws to prevent abuse. Informed by her military deployments, she views immigration enforcement as national security. Garrity promises to work with Trump administration on mass deportations while streamlining legal pathways for skilled workers. She opposes using state funds for migrant housing, redirecting to veterans and homeless citizens. This tough stance aims to protect jobs and public safety, appealing to Pennsylvania's working-class voters concerned about wage suppression and crime. (158 words)",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Garrity champions traditional family values, promoting policies that support marriage, parenthood, and child welfare. As a Christian wife, she prioritizes paid family leave, affordable childcare, and adoption incentives to strengthen families. Her platform opposes gender transition surgeries for minors and protects parental rights in education. She vows to defund Planned Parenthood and expand crisis pregnancy centers. Garrity supports school choice to empower parents and ban pornographic materials in libraries. Her vision includes tax credits for families with children and protecting religious adoption agencies from discrimination. Drawing from her service, she emphasizes military family support through housing and counseling. Garrity criticizes 'radical gender ideology' in schools, promising to safeguard innocence. This holistic approach aims to reverse cultural declines, fostering stable homes as society's foundation for prosperous Pennsylvania. (152 words)",
            "ELECTION-INTEGRITY": "Garrity is a vocal proponent of election security, having questioned 2020 results and attended a Jan. 6 rally. Her platform calls for voter ID, paper ballots, and same-day voting only, banning mail-in expansions. As Governor, she would audit voting machines, purge inactive voters, and prosecute fraud. She opposes ranked-choice voting and supports citizenship verification. Garrity pledges transparency in election administration, with bipartisan observers and real-time results. Her Treasurer experience informs demands for secure campaign finance tracking. She criticizes 'Big Tech' interference and vows to protect poll watchers' rights. This focus aims to restore trust in democracy, mobilizing GOP base amid 2024 controversies. Garrity promises Pennsylvania as a model for fair elections, ensuring every legal vote counts without dilution. (154 words)"
