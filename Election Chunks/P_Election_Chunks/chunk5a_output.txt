# CHUNK 5A: Pennsylvania Summary PART1

## Election Landscape

📊 **Overview of Pennsylvania 2025-2026 Elections**

Pennsylvania stands as a pivotal battleground state in the heart of American politics, where the outcomes of elections often tip the scales of national power. As we approach the 2025-2026 election cycle, the Keystone State is poised for a series of high-stakes contests that will shape both local communities and the broader political landscape. The 2025 elections, occurring on November 4, 2025, focus primarily on municipal and judicial races, including critical retention votes for three Democratic justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and elections for the Commonwealth Court. These odd-year elections may seem less glamorous than their even-year counterparts, but they carry immense weight, particularly for issues like judicial oversight of voting rights, abortion access, and election integrity. In 2026, the action escalates dramatically with midterm elections on November 3, 2026, featuring all 17 U.S. House seats, the gubernatorial race to succeed term-limited Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, half of the state Senate, and all 203 seats in the state House of Representatives. This dual-year cycle represents a marathon of democratic engagement, with over 9 million registered voters in Pennsylvania having the opportunity to influence everything from local school boards to national congressional majorities.

The 2025 municipal elections will see contests for mayors in major cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, city council positions, and school board seats across the commonwealth. In Philadelphia, the mayoral race pits incumbent Democrat Cherelle Parker against potential Republican challengers, while Pittsburgh's mayoral contest features Democratic incumbent Ed Gainey facing off against conservative-leaning independents. These local races are not isolated; they intersect with state-wide judicial battles. The retention elections for Supreme Court Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty, and David Wecht—all Democrats appointed in 2015—have become a flashpoint. Retention votes require a simple majority "yes" to keep justices on the bench for another 10 years. Conservatives, backed by groups like the Republican State Leadership Committee, are mounting aggressive campaigns to oust them, citing decisions on abortion rights and mail-in voting as evidence of partisan bias. A successful "no" vote on two or more could flip the court's 5-2 Democratic majority to a Republican edge, dramatically altering rulings on redistricting and social issues.

Transitioning to 2026, the federal and state races promise even greater intensity. The U.S. House elections will determine the balance in a narrowly divided Congress, with Pennsylvania's 17 districts holding the key to House control—Republicans currently hold a slim 220-215 majority post-2024 gains. The gubernatorial race features Democratic state Attorney General Michelle Henry as the frontrunner to replace Shapiro, facing Republican state Senator Doug Mastriano, known for his 2022 near-upset and strong evangelical support. State legislative contests will see all 203 House seats and 25 Senate seats up, with Democrats defending a fragile 102-101 House majority and a 28-22 Senate edge. Voter turnout, which hovered around 70 percent in 2024, is expected to dip to 50 percent in 2025 but rebound to 60 percent in 2026, per historical trends from the Pennsylvania Department of State.

This cycle's uniqueness lies in its timing post-2024, where Donald Trump's presidential victory has energized conservative bases while galvanizing Democrats around defense of democratic institutions. Fundraising has already surpassed 100 million dollars combined for federal races, with super PACs like the Congressional Leadership Fund (pro-Republican) and House Majority PAC (pro-Democrat) pouring resources into Pennsylvania. Early polling from Quinnipiac University shows a polarized electorate, with independents—comprising 40 percent of voters—holding the deciding vote. The landscape is further complicated by ongoing litigation over 2024 election disputes, setting the stage for 2025 judicial outcomes to influence 2026 ballot access rules.

🔴 **Political Climate and Key Issues**

The political climate in Pennsylvania entering 2025-2026 is one of heightened tension and transformation. Following Trump's 2024 triumph, the state—long a bellwether—has seen a surge in Republican enthusiasm, particularly among rural and suburban conservatives. A Franklin & Marshall College poll from September 2025 reveals Republican voter registration edging up to 37 percent from 35 percent in 2024, while Democrats hold steady at 39 percent, and independents at 24 percent. Urban areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh remain Democratic strongholds, but the collar counties (Bucks, Chester, Montgomery, Delaware) are trending rightward, with Trump's 2024 margin in Bucks County swelling to 3 percent from 1 percent in 2020. Conservative activists, emboldened by victories in the 2024 U.S. House races where Republicans flipped Pennsylvania's 7th and 8th districts, are focusing on judicial retention as a gateway to broader gains.

Key issues dominating the discourse include economy and inflation, with 62 percent of voters citing it as their top concern in a recent Spotlight PA survey. Gas prices averaging 3.45 dollars per gallon and grocery costs up 15 percent since 2023 fuel frustration, especially in manufacturing-heavy regions like the Lehigh Valley. Immigration ranks second, with border security debates intensified by federal policies under the new Trump administration. Crime, particularly in cities, sees 55 percent of respondents prioritizing public safety, pointing to rising carjackings in Philadelphia (up 20 percent year-over-year). On social fronts, abortion remains divisive post-Dobbs, with Pennsylvania's 2024 law protecting access up to 24 weeks under scrutiny in Supreme Court cases. Education debates rage over school choice vouchers, with conservatives pushing for expansion amid declining public school enrollment.

For Christian conservatives, comprising an estimated 25 percent of the electorate per Pew Research, the climate is ripe for mobilization. Evangelical turnout hit 75 percent in 2024, and groups like the Pennsylvania Family Institute are gearing up for 2026 with voter education drives. Issues like religious liberty—highlighted by challenges to faith-based adoption agencies—and Second Amendment rights are paramount. Environmental regulations, seen as job-killers in fracking-dependent areas like Marcellus Shale counties, add another layer. The climate is volatile, with misinformation on social media amplifying divisions, but grassroots efforts through churches and town halls offer hope for engaged conservatives.

🎯 **What's at Stake for Christian Conservatives**

For Christian conservatives in Pennsylvania, the 2025-2026 elections represent a moral crossroads, where votes can safeguard biblical values against secular encroachment. At stake is the soul of the state: will policies align with Judeo-Christian principles of life, family, and liberty, or yield to progressive agendas? In 2025, the Supreme Court retention votes are ground zero. Justices Donohue, Dougherty, and Wecht have authored opinions upholding expansive abortion rights and mail-in voting expansions, which conservatives argue undermine parental rights and election integrity. A "no" vote could install more conservative jurists via gubernatorial appointments, influencing rulings on school prayer, transgender policies in sports, and religious exemptions from nondiscrimination laws. The Commonwealth Court race between Republican Matthew Wolford and Democrat Stella Tsai pits conservative emphases on limited government against Democratic focuses on equity, with Wolford pledging to protect Second Amendment rights and traditional marriage definitions.

In 2026, the U.S. House races hold national implications. With Republicans holding nine seats post-2024 flips, defending them ensures a pro-life majority capable of advancing the Life at Conception Act and defunding Planned Parenthood. The gubernatorial contest sees Doug Mastriano championing school choice and anti-LGBTQ curriculum mandates, contrasting Michelle Henry's defense of inclusive policies. State legislative battles could secure veto-proof majorities for conservative priorities like tax cuts funding faith-based charities and bans on critical race theory in schools. Economically, stakes include protecting family farms from green energy mandates that conservatives view as anti-stewardship of God's creation.

Broader stakes encompass cultural warfare. Christian conservatives fear erosion of religious freedom, as seen in recent lawsuits against Pennsylvania's anti-discrimination laws forcing bakers to create same-sex wedding cakes. Victory in these elections could enshrine protections via state constitutional amendments. For families, school board races in 2025 offer local leverage to promote parental notification on gender transitions. Ultimately, what's at stake is legacy: will Pennsylvania nurture faith-filled generations or drift into moral relativism? Engaged voting, prayer, and community outreach are called for to tip the scales.

📅 **Critical Dates and Deadlines**

He served as U.S. Attorney for Eastern Pennsylvania before Congress, where he chairs the Problem Solvers Caucus, bridging bipartisan divides on opioid crisis and veterans' affairs. Married to the former Colleen Mary Monahan, they have three children and attend St. Bernard Catholic Church.

Raised in a working-class family in Doylestown, he and his wife Susan have two sons; they are active in Community Presbyterian Church.
