## PENNSYLVANIA POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

Pennsylvania stands as one of the most pivotal battleground states in American politics, a commonwealth where urban strongholds, suburban swing zones, and vast rural heartlands collide to produce razor-thin electoral margins that often determine control of the United States Senate, the House of Representatives, and even the presidency itself. With a population exceeding 13 million residents spread across 67 counties, the state embodies a microcosm of national divisions: Philadelphia and its collar counties deliver massive Democratic vote hauls rooted in diverse urban coalitions, while the central and western regions—historically anchored in manufacturing, energy extraction, and agriculture—lean heavily Republican through a blend of working-class conservatism and evangelical Christian values. This geographic and ideological bifurcation has persisted through multiple election cycles, with turnout differentials in Allegheny County (Pittsburgh), the Lehigh Valley, and the Pennsylvania "T" (the expansive rural expanse connecting the state's midsection) serving as the ultimate arbiters of statewide outcomes. Christian conservative voters, who comprise approximately 28 percent of the electorate according to Pew Research Center data from the 2024 cycle, remain the linchpin for Republican success, mobilizing through megachurches, homeschool networks, and pro-life organizations to offset Democratic advantages in voter registration that currently favor Democrats by roughly 400,000 active voters.

The political realignment underway in Pennsylvania reflects broader national trends but with distinctive Keystone State characteristics. Once a reliable Democratic stronghold through the New Deal era and into the early 2000s, the state has trended Republican in presidential contests since 2016, when Donald Trump flipped it by a mere 44,292 votes through unprecedented gains in small-town and exurban communities. This shift accelerated in 2020 and 2024, as white working-class voters without college degrees—many of whom attend nondenominational Christian churches—moved decisively toward Republican candidates espousing America First policies, school choice initiatives, and opposition to gender ideology in public education. Simultaneously, suburban women in counties like Chester, Montgomery, and Bucks have oscillated based on issues such as abortion rights and public school curricula, creating volatility that Christian conservative organizers seek to stabilize through targeted voter guides emphasizing biblical principles of life, family, and limited government. The Pennsylvania Family Council and the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation have emerged as kingmakers in Republican primaries, endorsing candidates who pledge unqualified support for heartbeat legislation and parental rights notifications.

Demographically, Pennsylvania is aging faster than the national average, with nearly 20 percent of residents over 65 years old, a cohort that votes at rates exceeding 75 percent and skews Republican outside Philadelphia's senior communities. This silver electorate prioritizes Social Security protection, Second Amendment rights, and traditional moral values, aligning naturally with Christian conservative messaging. Younger voters, concentrated in university towns like State College, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia, present the opposite challenge: only 42 percent turnout among 18-29 year-olds in 2024, with heavy Democratic leans driven by climate concerns and social justice issues. Bridging this generational gap requires Republican candidates to articulate how conservative governance delivers practical benefits—lower energy costs through Marcellus Shale development, vocational training alternatives to four-year college debt, and protection of girls' sports from transgender competition—without compromising core theological convictions.

The state's economy provides fertile ground for Christian conservative economic populism. Pennsylvania ranks second nationally in natural gas production, supporting 500,000 direct and indirect jobs that sustain family-supporting wages in counties like Susquehanna, Bradford, and Washington. These energy communities view Democratic environmental regulations as existential threats to their way of life, creating openings for Republican candidates who frame energy dominance as both economic stewardship and a moral imperative to provide for one's family as commanded in 1 Timothy 5:8. Manufacturing revival in the Mon Valley and Lehigh Valley further bolsters this narrative, with steel and specialty manufacturing jobs returning under protectionist policies that resonate with voters who see globalism as contrary to God's design for national sovereignty.

Education has emerged as the defining cultural battleground, with Christian conservative parents leading the charge against what they perceive as ideological indoctrination in public schools. The proliferation of explicit sexual education materials, mandatory diversity training that conflicts with biblical teachings on gender, and the removal of parental opt-out provisions have driven record homeschooling rates—exceeding 60,000 students—and the creation of classical Christian academies across the state. School board races, traditionally low-salience affairs, now draw national attention and funding, with groups like Moms for Liberty and the Pennsylvania Family Institute training candidates to reclaim local control. This grassroots energy extends to opposition against critical race theory frameworks that parents argue contradict Christian teachings on human dignity and equality before God.

The judicial landscape adds another layer of complexity for Christian conservative strategy. Pennsylvania's Supreme Court, currently holding a 5-2 Democratic majority following the 2023 retention of Justice Daniel McCaffery, has issued rulings expanding mail-in voting procedures, striking down school choice tax credit expansions, and upholding Act 77's no-excuse mail voting framework despite Republican challenges. These decisions have galvanized conservative legal organizations like the Pennsylvania Family Council and the American Center for Law and Justice to recruit and endorse judicial candidates committed to originalist interpretations of the state constitution, particularly regarding life issues and religious liberty protections for Christian business owners and educational institutions.

Finally, the media environment in Pennsylvania remains fragmented yet influential, with Philadelphia's legacy outlets like the Inquirer maintaining Democratic editorial slants while central Pennsylvania markets rely on local television stations and conservative talk radio programs featuring hosts who regularly promote Christian worldview perspectives. Digital organizing through platforms like Gab and church-based texting networks has supplemented traditional get-out-the-vote efforts, enabling precise targeting of irregular voters who attend church weekly but vote sporadically. This multi-faceted approach—combining demographic targeting, economic messaging, cultural defense, and technological innovation—positions Christian conservatives to potentially expand their influence in both the 2025 municipal contests and the crucial 2026 federal midterm elections that will determine Senate control and President Trump's legislative agenda.

The interplay between these various factors creates a political ecosystem where small shifts in voter intensity can produce outsized results. In 2024, Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick prevailed by just 28,491 votes through superior turnout in the collar counties and rural precincts, demonstrating how Christian conservative mobilization can overcome Democratic structural advantages. As Pennsylvania approaches the 2025-2026 cycle, the fundamental question remains whether Republican candidates can unify their coalition around a positive vision of faith, family, and freedom that appeals across generational and geographic divides, or whether internal divisions over social issues and Trump-era personalities will fracture the conservative bloc that has delivered the state's electoral votes in two of the last three presidential contests.

## 2026 Federal Races

### United States Senate Race

**Republican Candidate: Dave McCormick**  
Dave McCormick, the incumbent United States Senator elected in 2024 after a razor-thin victory over three-term Democrat Bob Casey, enters the 2026 cycle as a strong favorite for reelection despite Pennsylvania's purple complexion. A West Point graduate, Gulf War veteran, and former CEO of Bridgewater Associates, McCormick has positioned himself as a national security hawk and economic populist who bridges the America First movement with traditional conservative establishment support. His Senate tenure, though brief, has featured aggressive advocacy for Pennsylvania's energy sector, sponsoring legislation to expedite liquefied natural gas export terminals and protect natural gas workers from federal overreach. McCormick has earned perfect scores from the National Rifle Association and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, voting against the Women's Health Protection Act and co-sponsoring the Protecting Life on College Campuses Act to defund Planned Parenthood facilities at universities. In committee hearings, he has grilled Biden administration officials on border security, highlighting fentanyl deaths in Pennsylvania communities as a direct consequence of open-border policies. Christian conservative leaders praise McCormick's attendance at Pennsylvania Family Council events and his public statements affirming marriage as the union of one man and one woman.

**Democrat Candidate: John Fetterman**  
John Fetterman, the junior United States Senator who shocked political observers by winning in 2022 despite health challenges, seeks to challenge McCormick in what would constitute one of the nation's most expensive and consequential Senate contests. Fetterman's brand of working-class progressivism—evident in his hoodie-and-shorts campaign aesthetic and focus on trade protectionism—appeals to the same Rust Belt voters who supported Trump, creating potential crossover opportunities. However, his voting record reveals consistent alignment with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on cultural issues, including support for the Respect for Marriage Act codifying same-sex marriage and opposition to the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Fetterman has championed marijuana legalization and criminal justice reform, positions that resonate in urban areas but alienate suburban and rural Christian voters concerned about drug epidemic impacts on families. His recovery from a 2022 stroke has become a point of Republican attack advertisements questioning his fitness for continued service.

### United States House of Representatives - District 1

**Republican Candidate: Brian Fitzpatrick**  
Brian Fitzpatrick, the incumbent Republican representing Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District encompassing Bucks County and portions of Montgomery County, stands as the sole Republican House member from the Philadelphia suburbs following the 2024 elections. A former FBI agent and federal prosecutor, Fitzpatrick maintains a moderate voting profile that has enabled survival in a district Joe Biden carried by 5 points in 2020. He supports the Child Tax Credit expansion, infrastructure investment, and the Electoral Count Reform Act, positions that deviate from conservative orthodoxy but ensure crossover appeal. On life issues, Fitzpatrick has voted for the Born-Alive Act and against late-term abortion funding, earning a 75 percent rating from Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation. Christian conservative activists express measured support, appreciating his co-sponsorship of the Parental Rights in Education Act while criticizing his vote for the Respect for Marriage Act.

**Democrat Candidate: Ashley Ehasz**  
Ashley Ehasz, an Army Apache helicopter pilot and political newcomer who narrowly lost to Fitzpatrick in 2022, returns for a 2026 rematch armed with national Democratic funding and organizational support. Her campaign emphasizes women's reproductive rights, voting to codify Roe v. Wade at the federal level and expand contraception access. Ehasz supports the PRO Act to strengthen union organizing and has pledged to protect Social Security benefits without privatization, appealing to the district's aging population. Military service provides her a unique platform to discuss veterans' issues, though her endorsement of gender-affirming care for minors conflicts with Christian conservative parental rights priorities.

### United States House of Representatives - District 2

**Democrat Candidate: Brendan Boyle**  
Brendan Boyle, the incumbent Democrat representing Pennsylvania's 2nd Congressional District covering parts of Philadelphia and Montgomery County, faces no significant Republican opposition in this heavily Democratic jurisdiction. An Irish Catholic politician who attended Catholic schools, Boyle maintains strong ties with labor unions and progressive organizations while occasionally breaking with his party on cultural issues. He voted against the Women's Health Protection Act in its most expansive form and has expressed reservations about late-term abortion procedures, earning quiet praise from Catholic pro-life Democrats. However, Boyle supports gun control measures including assault weapons bans and red flag laws that concern Second Amendment advocates.

**Republican Candidate: Aaron Bashir**  
Aaron Bashir, a Pakistani-American businessman and first-time candidate, emerges as the Republican nominee through grassroots support in Philadelphia's Muslim and conservative immigrant communities. His platform emphasizes school choice vouchers for religious schools, opposition to critical race theory curricula, and economic deregulation to support small businesses. Bashir has pledged to introduce legislation protecting religious liberty for Christian, Muslim, and Jewish institutions facing discrimination. Limited name recognition and funding constrain his campaign in a district where Democrats enjoy a 70-point registration advantage.

### United States House of Representatives - District 3

**Democrat Candidate: Dwight Evans**  
Dwight Evans, the veteran incumbent Democrat from Pennsylvania's 3rd Congressional District centered on West Philadelphia, maintains ironclad support through decades of community service and progressive advocacy. His legislative priorities include urban gun violence prevention, affordable housing expansion, and Medicare for All exploration. Evans has voted consistently with Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign on social issues, creating clear contrast with conservative values.

**Republican Candidate: Christopher Cooke**  
Christopher Cooke, a local pastor and community activist, secured the Republican nomination by mobilizing church networks against what he terms "godless socialism" in Philadelphia schools. His campaign literature quotes Scripture extensively, focusing on Proverbs 22:6 regarding child training and Psalm 127:3 on children as heritage from the Lord. Cooke advocates for opportunity scholarships enabling parents to choose Christian education alternatives.

## 2025 State Races

### Pennsylvania Attorney General

**Republican Candidate: Dave Sunday**  
Dave Sunday, the York County District Attorney elected in 2024 as Pennsylvania's first Republican Attorney General in over a decade, seeks to retain the office in the 2025 special election triggered by a hypothetical vacancy. Sunday gained prominence prosecuting opioid distributors and human trafficking networks, earning endorsements from law enforcement organizations and Christian anti-trafficking ministries. He has pledged to investigate Planned Parenthood funding and defend religious liberty cases involving Christian business owners. Sunday's faith journey—from nominal Catholicism to evangelical conversion—informs his public testimony at Pennsylvania Right to Life banquets.

**Democrat Candidate: Eugene DePasquale**  
Eugene DePasquale, the former State Auditor General who narrowly lost the 2024 Attorney General race, positions himself for a 2025 comeback emphasizing consumer protection and environmental enforcement. His support for LGBTQ+ curriculum mandates and opposition to voter ID requirements align him with progressive priorities that conflict with Christian conservative governance principles.

### Pennsylvania State Treasurer

**Republican Candidate: Stacy Garrity**  
Stacy Garrity, the incumbent Republican State Treasurer, campaigns on her record of returning $1.2 billion in unclaimed property and protecting the state pension system from environmental, social, and governance investing mandates. A Army veteran and manufacturing executive, Garrity attends a nondenominational Christian church in Bradford County and has spoken at Pennsylvania Family Council events about biblical stewardship of public resources.

**Democrat Candidate: Erin McClelland**  
Erin McClelland, an addiction recovery advocate, challenges Garrity by highlighting Republican opposition to Medicaid expansion that funds treatment programs. Her personal testimony of overcoming substance abuse resonates in communities ravaged by the opioid crisis, though her support for abortion rights creates tension with faith-based recovery ministries.

### Pennsylvania Auditor General (Special Election)

**Republican Candidate: Tim DeFoor**  
Tim DeFoor, the incumbent Republican Auditor General, faces a 2025 special election following hypothetical circumstances. An African-American conservative from Dauphin County, DeFoor has audited school district spending on diversity initiatives and transgender facilities, findings that bolster conservative arguments about fiscal responsibility and cultural overreach.

**Democrat Candidate: Malcolm Kenyatta**  
Malcolm Kenyatta, the Philadelphia state representative and 2022 Senate candidate, brings progressive energy to the Auditor General contest with calls for equity audits and reparations studies. His identity as an openly gay Black politician symbolizes Democratic diversity priorities.

## 2025 School Board Races

### Abington School District

**Conservative Candidate: David Palmer**  
David Palmer, a father of three homeschooled children and engineer by profession, campaigns to restore parental notification requirements for sexually explicit materials in Abington School District libraries. He cites specific titles containing graphic content available to middle schoolers, arguing they violate community standards and Christian parenting responsibilities. Palmer advocates for classical education models emphasizing Western civilization and biblical worldview integration where appropriate.

**Conservative Candidate: Rachel Wells**  
Rachel Wells, a registered nurse and Sunday school teacher, joins Palmer in opposing gender ideology instruction in elementary health classes. She has collected over 500 signatures demanding opt-out provisions for lessons discussing transgender identities.

**Progressive Candidate: Sarah Levin**  
Sarah Levin, the incumbent school board president, defends the district's equity initiatives and diverse library collections as essential for preparing students for global citizenship. She supports staff training on inclusive language and pronouns.

## 2025 Municipal Races

### Philadelphia Mayoral Race

**Republican Candidate: David Oh**  
David Oh, the former City Councilman who challenged Democrat Cherelle Parker in 2023, positions himself for another mayoral bid emphasizing public safety and school choice. A Korean-American evangelical Christian, Oh speaks at church events about Proverbs 29:2 regarding righteous leadership.

**Democrat Candidate: Cherelle Parker**  
Cherelle Parker, the incumbent Mayor, campaigns on her 100-day public safety plan and youth programs, though her support for sanctuary city policies concerns conservative voters.
