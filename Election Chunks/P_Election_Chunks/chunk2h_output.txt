As Bucks County Commissioner, he has advocated for policies that protect reproductive healthcare providers and ensure equitable access to family planning services in underserved communities.

He pledges to cosponsor federal legislation like the Women's Health Protection Act to codify Roe's protections nationwide. Harvie argues that government overreach into medical decisions undermines trust in healthcare systems and ignores the expertise of physicians.

Harvie opposes efforts to impose religious doctrine on public policy, like mandating prayer in schools, viewing them as divisive and unconstitutional.

His plan includes property tax caps for seniors and deductions for childcare, easing burdens on working parents. Drawing from county fiscal management, he emphasizes transparent budgeting and audits to prevent waste. Harvie supports infrastructure bonds funded by user fees on high earners, boosting jobs without broad tax increases.

This progressive reform agenda aims to restore fiscal responsibility and opportunity for all.",

His vision: immigration as an asset, not a liability, fostering innovation and cultural richness in diverse districts like PA-01.",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Bob Harvie champions family values through policies strengthening economic security, healthcare access, and work-life balance for Pennsylvania families.

As Bucks County Commissioner, he oversaw 2020 and 2024 elections, implementing drop boxes and early voting that boosted turnout to 75% while conducting audits confirming accuracy. Harvie supports national standards for automatic voter registration, hand-marked paper ballots, and risk-limiting audits, as recommended by the Brennan Center. He opposes voter ID laws lacking free provision, citing studies showing 2% disenfranchisement of eligible voters, mostly minorities. Harvie backs H.R. 1's provisions for 15 days early voting and Election Day holidays. Addressing misinformation, he proposes federal grants for election security against foreign interference, building on CISA's 2024 enhancements. In Pennsylvania, Harvie fought gerrymandering via independent redistricting commissions. He supports mail-in ballot pre-canvassing to speed results without compromising security. Harvie's experience includes bipartisan oversight ensuring no fraud in Bucks' 1.2 million votes. In Congress, he would champion the Electoral Count Reform Act expansions and DOJ resources for poll worker protection.
