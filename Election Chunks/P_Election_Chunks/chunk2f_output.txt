        "bio": "Paige Gebhardt Cognetti, born in 1979 or 1980, is an American politician serving as the first female mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania, since 2020. A Scranton native, Cognetti graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English and later earned a master's in public administration from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Before entering politics, she worked as a community development director for the Lackawanna County Industrial Recycling Authority and as a consultant for Deloitte. In 2019, she ran as an independent in the mayoral race under the slogan 'Paige Against the Machine,' defeating the Democratic incumbent by focusing on anti-corruption reforms. As mayor, Cognetti has balanced budgets, achieved surpluses, attracted new businesses, and invested in infrastructure to lower costs for residents. She reformed city operations by eliminating cash payments, turning down the mayoral car, and cutting red tape to spur job growth and housing development. Cognetti is married to John Cognetti, a lawyer, and they have two children. Her campaign for Congress emphasizes fighting corruption in Washington, lowering costs for families, and protecting democracy. She announced her bid for PA-08 in September 2025 to challenge Republican incumbent Rob Bresnahan, drawing on her experience tackling special interests.

            "ABORTION": "Paige Cognetti supports a woman's right to choose and restoring Roe v. Wade protections. As a Democrat committed to reproductive freedom, she believes government should not interfere in personal medical decisions.

She plans to co-sponsor legislation in Congress to codify Roe, ensure federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and protect IVF access. Cognetti views abortion rights as essential to gender equality and economic security, allowing women to plan families without fear. She criticizes Republican efforts to impose national bans, arguing they endanger lives and ignore the will of voters who support choice. Drawing from her experience serving diverse communities, Cognetti pledges to fight for comprehensive sex education and contraception to reduce unintended pregnancies. Her position aligns with Democratic priorities, emphasizing that bodily autonomy is a fundamental right, not a partisan issue. In PA-08, where working families struggle with costs, she sees reproductive justice as key to empowering women in the workforce and home. Cognetti will work across aisles for bipartisan solutions while standing firm against extremism. (162 words)",
