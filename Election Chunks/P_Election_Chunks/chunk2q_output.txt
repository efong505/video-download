            "ABORTION": "Ryan Mackenzie holds a firmly pro-life position, believing that life begins at conception and that government has a moral obligation to protect the unborn. As a state representative, he supported legislation requiring the proper disposal of fetal remains after abortions and opposed funding for organizations like Planned Parenthood that perform abortions. In Congress, Mackenzie has pledged to defund Planned Parenthood and support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which bans abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. He advocates for state-level restrictions on abortion following the Dobbs decision, allowing Pennsylvania to enact protections like parental notification and bans on late-term procedures except in cases to save the mother's life. Mackenzie emphasizes alternatives such as adoption support and crisis pregnancy centers, arguing that society must promote a culture of life that values families and children. His stance is rooted in his Catholic faith and conservative principles, viewing abortion as a human rights issue comparable to slavery or the Holocaust. He opposes any federal funding for abortions and supports the Hyde Amendment. Mackenzie has criticized Democrats for extreme positions on late-term abortions and vows to fight against codifying Roe v. Wade. In the 7th District, where family values are paramount, he commits to advancing policies that reduce abortion rates through economic support for mothers, expanded healthcare access for women, and education on fetal development. This comprehensive approach aims to lower the demand for abortions while upholding constitutional limits on federal power. (178 words)",
            "EDUCATION": "Mackenzie supports school choice and parental rights in education, opposing federal overreach and Common Core standards. He has backed voucher programs and charter schools to empower parents in selecting the best educational options for their children, particularly in underperforming public schools in the Lehigh Valley.

In Congress, Mackenzie prioritizes expanding Pell Grants for vocational training and eliminating student loan forgiveness that burdens taxpayers.

Ultimately, his vision restores local control, fosters competition among schools, and ensures every child has the opportunity to succeed regardless of zip code. (192 words)",
            "RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM": "Mackenzie is a staunch defender of religious freedom, viewing it as a cornerstone of the First Amendment and essential to America's founding principles.

In the Pennsylvania House, he supported exemptions for religious institutions from nondiscrimination laws that could force them to violate beliefs on marriage or gender. In Congress, Mackenzie has co-sponsored the Religious Freedom Restoration Act amendments to protect houses of worship and faith-based charities from burdensome regulations. He criticizes the Biden administration's attacks on religious liberty, including policies on transgender athletes in women's sports that conflict with religious convictions.

Rated A by the NRA, he opposes all forms of gun control, including assault weapon bans and red flag laws, arguing they infringe on constitutional rights without reducing crime. As a state representative, he supported concealed carry reciprocity and opposed gun-free zones in schools. In Congress, Mackenzie vows to block universal background checks and defend the Heller decision. He emphasizes enforcing existing laws against felons and the mentally ill while supporting mental health funding to address root causes of violence. In rural Pennsylvania's 7th District, where hunting is a tradition, Mackenzie champions protecting manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits and expanding range facilities. He criticizes Democrats' focus on guns over border security, which he sees as the true source of illegal firearms. His plan includes streamlining suppressor regulations for hunters and promoting safe storage education without mandates. Mackenzie's personal experience with firearms underscores his belief that armed citizens deter crime, citing statistics from right-to-carry states. By upholding the Second Amendment, he aims to empower law-abiding citizens and honor the sacrifices of veterans who fought for these freedoms. (172 words)",

In Harrisburg, he voted for property tax elimination for seniors and corporate tax reductions that created jobs. In Congress, Mackenzie proposes eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, overtime pay, and tips to put more money in families' pockets.

His fiscal conservatism includes auditing federal agencies for efficiency and returning surpluses to taxpayers.

Mackenzie's record demonstrates a proven track record of tax relief that boosted the economy without increasing deficits. (168 words)",
            "IMMIGRATION": "Mackenzie demands secure borders and enforcement of immigration laws to protect American workers and communities. He supports completing the border wall, ending catch-and-release, and reinstating Remain in Mexico policies. Opposing amnesty for 11 million illegals, he favors merit-based legal immigration that prioritizes skills and assimilation. As a state legislator, he backed E-Verify mandates for employers to prevent hiring undocumented workers. In Congress, Mackenzie co-sponsors bills to defund sanctuary cities and increase ICE funding. In Pennsylvania's 7th District, strained by opioid inflows from the border, he addresses fentanyl trafficking as a national security threat. Mackenzie criticizes Biden's open-border policies for overwhelming schools and hospitals, advocating for expedited deportations of criminals. His plan includes reforming asylum rules to stop abuse and expanding visa programs for high-tech talent. By prioritizing citizens, he aims to restore rule of law and economic opportunities for legal immigrants and natives alike. Mackenzie's tough stance reflects voter concerns in the Lehigh Valley about job competition and public safety. (162 words)",
            "FAMILY-VALUES": "Guided by traditional family values, Mackenzie promotes policies that strengthen marriages, support parents, and protect children.

By fostering a culture that values life and responsibility, he believes communities will be safer and more prosperous. (158 words)",
            "ELECTION-INTEGRITY": "Mackenzie is a vocal proponent of election integrity, supporting voter ID requirements, paper ballots, and same-day voting to prevent fraud. He opposed Pennsylvania's no-excuse mail-in voting expansion, citing vulnerabilities exploited in 2020. In Congress, he backs the SAVE Act for proof of citizenship and audits of 2020 results. As state representative, he pushed for cleaning voter rolls and prohibiting drop boxes. In the 7th District, he addresses concerns over non-citizen voting by mandating verification. Mackenzie criticizes Big Tech censorship and pledges to ban private funding of elections. His plan includes federal standards for secure machines and penalties for violations. By restoring trust through transparency, he aims to ensure every legal vote counts and illegal ones do not.
