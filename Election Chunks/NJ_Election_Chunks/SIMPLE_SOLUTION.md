# Simple Solution: Focus on Top 50 Candidates Only

## Reality Check

**You don't need 150 candidates for a useful voter guide.**

## Recommended Approach: Top 50 High-Quality Candidates

### Federal Races (30 candidates)
- U.S. Senate: 4 candidates (Booker, Bashaw, Khalil, Kaplan)
- U.S. House (12 districts × 2): 24 candidates
- **Total: 28 federal candidates**

### Statewide Races (6 candidates)
- Governor: 6 candidates (Ciattarelli, Sherrill, Baraka, Fulop, Spadea, Bramnick)

### Top State Legislative Races (16 candidates)
- 8 most competitive Assembly districts × 2 candidates each
- Focus on swing districts

**Grand Total: 50 complete, high-quality candidate profiles**

## Why This Works Better

1. **Manageable**: 5 chunks of 10 candidates each
2. **Quality**: Full 200-300 word bios for each
3. **Useful**: Covers all races voters care about most
4. **Scalable**: Same approach works for all 50 states

## The 5 Chunks You Need

**CHUNK_2A (1-10)**: U.S. Senate (4) + House Districts 1-3 (6)
**CHUNK_2B (11-20)**: House Districts 4-8 (10)
**CHUNK_2C (21-30)**: House Districts 9-12 (8) + Governor (2)
**CHUNK_2D (31-40)**: Governor (4 more) + Top Assembly races (6)
**CHUNK_2E (41-50)**: Top Assembly races (10 more)

## Token Limits Explained

**Grok AI (xAI):**
- Input: ~128K tokens
- Output: ~4K tokens (sometimes up to 8K)

**Why 10 candidates per chunk:**
- Each candidate = ~400-500 tokens
- 10 candidates = ~4,000-5,000 tokens
- Right at the limit (may still abbreviate)

**If 10 still fails, use 8 per chunk:**
- 8 candidates = ~3,200-4,000 tokens
- Safer margin
- 50 candidates = 7 chunks instead of 5

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test CHUNK_2A (candidates 1-10) in Grok
2. If it works completely → continue with 2B-2E
3. If it abbreviates → reduce to 8 candidates per chunk
4. Focus on quality over quantity

**You already have:**
- ✅ CHUNK_1 (128 races)
- ✅ CHUNK_2A (ready to test)
- ✅ CHUNK_2B (ready to test)
- ✅ CHUNK_5 (summary - works fine)

**Just need to test and iterate!**
