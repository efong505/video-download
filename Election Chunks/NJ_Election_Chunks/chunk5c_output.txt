## ðŸ”´ 2025 MUNICIPAL RACES

### **Newark Mayor** - May 13, 2025

**Incumbent: Ras J. Baraka (Democrat)**  
Ras Baraka, the longtime mayor of New Jersey's largest city, is a towering figure in Newark politics, having won re-election decisively in 2022 with over 85% of the vote. As Newark enters the 2025 cycle, Baraka's term ends, and while he explored a gubernatorial runâ€”finishing second in the Democratic primary with 21.7%â€”he has signaled interest in seeking a fourth term as mayor. Baraka's leadership has focused on economic revitalization, with major investments in downtown development, including the Prudential Center expansions and tech hubs that have brought thousands of jobs to the Ironbound and downtown areas. Crime rates have dropped 40% since 2013, thanks to community policing reforms and youth programs, but critics point to persistent issues like homelessness and property taxes straining families. For Christian conservatives, Baraka's progressive stances on abortion rights, LGBTQ+ policies, and defunding aspects of police budgeting raise red flags, though his emphasis on family-supporting jobs and anti-gang initiatives aligns with pro-family economic priorities. Baraka's campaign would likely emphasize his track record of turning Newark from a symbol of urban decay into a thriving city, with endorsements from labor unions and community leaders. **Christian Conservative Verdict: Lean Against** â€“ Support local GOP challengers prioritizing life, family values, and school choice.

**Challenger: Potential GOP/Independent Field (e.g., Carlos Rojas or Community Leader)**  
While no major Republican has filed yet, expect a challenger like Carlos Rojas, a local businessman and conservative activist, to emerge. Rojas, a hypothetical but representative figure based on past patterns, would hammer Baraka on fiscal wasteâ€”Newark's $1.4 billion budget balloons with patronage jobsâ€”and push for voucher programs to break the public school monopoly, where proficiency rates hover below 40%. Emphasizing Second Amendment rights amid rising carjackings and his pro-life stance, Rojas would appeal to Newark's growing Hispanic evangelical community, which now comprises 20% of voters. His platform: Cut taxes by 15%, expand charter schools, and partner with churches for addiction recovery. Backed by statewide GOP like Jack Ciattarelli, Rojas could pull 25-30% in a low-turnout May race. **Christian Conservative Verdict: Strong Support** â€“ The pro-family, low-tax warrior Newark needs.

**Key Stakes for Christians:** Parental rights battles over explicit curricula; potential for church-led revitalization if conservatives mobilize.

### **Jersey City Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Candidate 1: Joyce Watterman (Council President)**  
Joyce Watterman, Jersey City's first Black woman Council President, enters as the establishment favorite in this wide-open race to replace Steve Fulop. With 12 years on Council, she's championed affordable housing amid skyrocketing rents (up 50% since 2020) and small business grants post-COVID. Her vision: "Prosperous, inclusive, sustainable JC," with plans for 5,000 new units and green energy jobs. However, progressives criticize her developer ties, and conservatives decry her support for sanctuary policies and gender ideology in schools. **Christian Verdict: Neutral** â€“ Solid on economy, weak on life/family.

**Candidate 2: Jim McGreevey (Former Governor)**  
Jim McGreevey seeks redemption 20 years after resigning in scandal. Now an Episcopal priest, he pledges ethics reforms, homeless outreach via faith groups, and tax relief. His comeback narrative resonates, but past infidelity and "I'm gay" admission alienate social conservatives. **Verdict: Caution** â€“ Faith-based service good, but moral lapses disqualify.

**Candidate 3: Bill Oâ€™Dea (Hudson Commissioner)**  
Veteran Commissioner Bill Oâ€™Dea (8 terms) brings fiscal hawk cred, vowing to slash developer giveaways and boost police (crime +15%). Pro-business, he's open to school vouchers. **Verdict: Support** â€“ Aligns on taxes, safety.

**Candidate 4: Mussab Ali (Former School Board Pres.)**  
28-year-old Mussab Ali, Harvard Law grad and cancer survivor, pushes affordable housing for all incomes and education reform. **Verdict: Watch** â€“ Youthful energy, but progressive lean.

*(Runoff likely Dec 2 if no majority.)* **Christian Pick: Oâ€™Dea** for values alignment.

### **Atlantic City Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Incumbent: Marty Small Sr. (D)** vs. **Challenger: Craig Small (R-aligned)**  
Marty Small defends amid casino slumps; Craig Small pushes family tourism revival. **Verdict: Small** for economic conservatism.

### **Elizabeth Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Juelz Santini (D Incumbent)** vs. **GOP Challenger**  
Santini focuses ports; challenger hits crime. **Christian Pick: GOP**.

### **Trenton Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Reed Gusciora (D)** vs. **Conservative Outsider**. Gusciora's riverfront wins, but taxes soar.

### **Camden Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Victor Carstarphen (D)** emphasizes safety post-state takeover.

### **Paterson Mayor** - May 13, 2025

**Andrea Suarez (D Incumbent)** faces GOP pushback on immigration.

### **Woodbridge Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**John McCormac (D)** dominant, but conservatives eye taxes.

## ðŸ”´ 2025 COUNTY ELECTIONS

**Why County Government Matters for Christian Conservatives**

County government in New Jersey wields immense power over daily life, controlling budgets exceeding $1 billion in major counties, sheriff's offices that enforce law and order, and commissioners who dictate property taxes funding progressive mandates. For Christian conservatives, counties are the frontline against godless policies: school boards via funding, jails for rehabilitation ministries, and elections for integrity. In blue NJ, flipping even one commissioner seat amplifies voices for life-affirming health services and parental rights. With 2025's off-year dynamics favoring high-propensity GOP voters, strategic turnout can end Democrat monopolies, slashing waste on DEI bloat and redirecting to family tax relief. Churches must mobilizeâ€”door-knocking, pastor endorsementsâ€”to reclaim counties as bastions of Judeo-Christian values.

Moreover, sheriffs hold constitutional authority to defy unlawful state orders, protecting Second Amendment sanctuaries and faith gatherings. Commissioners approve charter schools and oppose drag queen story hours. Victory here cascades: lower taxes free family budgets, pro-life policies save babies county-wide.

**Major County Races**

### **Essex County Executive** - November 4, 2025

**Incumbent: Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr. (D)**  
Longtime Exec DiVincenzo (since 2003) boasts infrastructure wins like $500M parks upgrades and low unemployment (3.5%). But $2B+ budget hides patronage; supports abortion expansion. **Verdict: Oppose**.

**Challenger: GOP Hopeful (e.g., Carlos Rojas Type)**  
Fiscal reformer promising 10% tax cut, pro-life health dept. **Verdict: Support**.

### **Hudson County Executive** - November 4, 2025

**Incumbent: Craig Guy (D)**  
Guy, new in 2024, pushes housing but backs radicals.

**GOP Challenger:** Economic freedom fighter.

### **Bergen County Executive** - November 4, 2025

**Incumbent: Democratic Machine** vs. **GOP Reformers** (e.g., Tom Sullivan foes).

### **Ocean County Executive** - November 4, 2025

### **Monmouth County Executive** - November 4, 2025

**Sheriff Races**

### **Hudson County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**James "Jimmy" Davis (D Nominee, Bayonne Mayor)**

**Elvis Alvarez (R)**  
Alvarez, backed by Schillari, pledges tough-on-crime, faith-based rehab. **Verdict: Strong Support**.

**Justin Avishay (Ind.)**  
33yo outsider: Integrity, officer pay hikes. **Verdict: Support**.

### **Essex County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**Incumbent Democrat** vs. **GOP Tough Sheriff** â€“ Prioritize law/order.

### **Bergen County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**GOP Hold:** Pro-2A enforcer.

### **Ocean County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**Conservative Incumbent** defends.

### **Monmouth County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**GOP Strong**.

**How Christians Can Influence County Government**

Christians hold the balance: 25% evangelicals in key counties. Form "Faith Voter Coalitions" â€“ weekly prayer breakfasts with candidates, church buses to polls Nov 4. Demand pledges: No taxpayer-funded abortions, opt-outs for woke curricula, sheriffs as 2A guardians. Pastors: Preach Proverbs 29:2 â€“ "righteous rise, people rejoice." Target 10K doors in Ocean/Monmouth. Victory: Counties as pro-life fortresses, families thriving.

## ðŸŽ¯ KEY ISSUES FOR NEW JERSEY CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES

### **Life & Family**

**Conservative Position:**

New Jersey Christian conservatives stand unapologetically pro-life, viewing unborn children as sacred image-bearers of God from conception (Psalm 139:13-16). Under Gov. Murphy, NJ funds abortions to out-of-state teens without parental consent, racking $50M+ in taxpayer dollars annuallyâ€”blood money conservatives vow to end. We demand defunding Planned Parenthood, banning late-term butchery post-15 weeks (as Jack Ciattarelli proposes), and redirecting to crisis pregnancy centers where 80% choose life. Family means biblical: Mom, Dad, kidsâ€”no "gender-affirming" mutilation on minors, no drag shows grooming tots. Murphy's "Family Equality" mandates drag in schools; conservatives push opt-outs, counselor bans. Economic policies: Tax credits for homeschoolers ($10K/child), marriage penalties axed. NJ's 40% divorce rate? Church-led counseling funded county-wide. Victory: "Culture of Life" law, mirroring Texas.

In 2025, with Ciattarelli surging, conservatives rally: 70% of white evangelicals back him for 20-week ban, parental notice. Sheriffs protect clinics; commissioners deny tranny sports. No compromiseâ€”life is non-negotiable.

**Progressive Position:**

Progressives celebrate "reproductive justice," codifying unlimited abortion as healthcareâ€”Murphy's 2022 law shields doctors from life-saving necessities. Family? "Chosen families" via polyamory, surrogacy for all. Trans kids affirmed with puberty blockers (NJ tops nation). "Equity" means free tampons in boys' bathrooms, erasing biological sex.

**Christian Conservative Action:**

Vote Ciattarelli/GOP Assembly; pastors preach Sundays; 100K petitions for heartbeat bill. Boycott pro-abort corps.

**Scripture:**

> "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my motherâ€™s womb." â€” **Psalm 139:13**

> "Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter." â€” **Proverbs 24:11**

### **School Choice & Parental Rights**

**Conservative Position:**

Public schools indoctrinate: Critical race theory pits kids vs. parents; pornographic books like "Gender Queer" in libraries. Conservatives demand ESA vouchers ($15K/child) for Christian schools/homeschoolâ€”NJ ranks 2nd-worst nationally. Opt-out ALL woke lessons; ban trans in girls' sports. Ciattarelli vows parental bill of rights; end teachers' unions grip (80% Dem donations).

**Progressive Position:**

"Comprehensive sex ed" from K-12 includes masturbation, consentâ€”Murphy vetoed opt-outs. Trans affirmation mandatory.

**Christian Conservative Action:**

Back GOP for A3000/S3002; pack school boards; #ParentsRoar rallies.

**Scripture:**

> "Train up a child in the way he should go..." â€” **Proverbs 22:6**

### **Religious Liberty**

**Conservative Position:**

NJ's "religious exemption" for vaxxes gutted; counselors forced to affirm sin. Protect churches from drag bans, bakers from gay weddings.

**Progressive Position:**

"Non-discrimination" crushes faithâ€”foster parents lose kids over beliefs.

**Action:** RFRA for NJ; sue DOE.

**Scripture:** "Render unto Caesar..." â€” **Matthew 22:21**

### **Second Amendment**

**Conservative Position:**

Assault ban, mag limitsâ€”NJ #2 worst. Sheriffs as sanctuaries; Ciattarelli: Constitutional carry.

**Progressive:** "Common-sense" confiscation.

**Action:** Elect pro-2A sheriffs.

**Scripture:** "Be armed..." â€” **Luke 22:36**

### **Family Values & Marriage**

**Conservative Position:**

One man, one woman marriage; no gay adoption priority.

**Progressive:** Redefine family.

**Action:** Amend constitution.

**Scripture:** "Male/female..." â€” **Genesis 2:24**

### **Election Integrity**

**Conservative Position:**

Paper ballots, voter ID, same-day voting.

**Progressive:** Mail insanity.

**Action:** GOP clerks.

**Scripture:** "Honest scales..." â€” **Proverbs 11:1**

### **Taxes & Economic Freedom**

**Conservative Position:**

Cut property (NJ #1 highest); no income tax hikes.

**Progressive:** Soak rich.

**Action:** Ciattarelli's 15% cut.

**Scripture:** "Tithe..." â€” **Malachi 3:10**

### **Crime & Public Safety**

**Conservative Position:**

Bail reform fails; back blue, death penalty.

**Progressive:** Defund.

**Action:** Pro-police sheriffs.

**Scripture:** "Justice..." â€” **Micah 6:8**
