Raised in a middle-class family in New Jersey, Booker attended Stanford University on a football scholarship, earning a bachelor's in political science and master's in sociology. He studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and graduated from Yale Law School. After law school, Booker worked as a program director for a Newark nonprofit, providing legal aid to low-income tenants. In 1998, he was elected to the Newark City Council, becoming council president in 2002. He ran for mayor in 2002 but lost amid allegations of impropriety by incumbent Sharpe James. Booker won the mayoralty in 2006, serving until 2013. As mayor, he reduced the city budget deficit from $180 million to $73 million, doubled affordable housing development, and improved public safety metrics. Appointed to the Senate in 2013 after Frank Lautenberg's death, Booker won special and full-term elections. In the Senate, he has focused on criminal justice reform, co-sponsoring the First Step Act; cannabis legalization; and racial equity. He ran for president in 2020, emphasizing unity and 'love in action.' Booker chairs the Senate Democratic Strategic Communications Committee. He lives in Newark's Central Ward, remains unmarried, and is known for his veganism and fitness.

## 🔴 NEW JERSEY POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Garden State**

New Jersey, known as the Garden State, stands as a complex political battleground where dense urban centers clash with sprawling suburban enclaves and rural farmlands, creating a mosaic of ideological tensions that make every election cycle a high-stakes referendum on American values. With a population exceeding 9.2 million residents, the state is the most densely populated in the nation, yet it retains pockets of conservative strength in its southern and northwestern counties that often feel overlooked by the Democratic dominance in Trenton and the urban north. The political landscape is shaped by a historic Democratic stronghold in cities like Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Camden, where union influence, public sector employment, and progressive social policies have entrenched a liberal governing class for decades. However, beneath this surface lies a growing undercurrent of discontent among working-class families, small business owners, and faith-based communities who increasingly view the state’s leadership as out of touch with traditional American principles, particularly on issues of life, family, religious liberty, and parental rights in education.

The urban-rural divide in New Jersey is not merely geographic but deeply cultural and spiritual. In the northeastern corridor, particularly Essex, Hudson, and Union counties, Democratic machines have maintained near-total control through a combination of high voter turnout, robust get-out-the-vote operations, and policy platforms that emphasize government expansion, social justice frameworks, and secular progressive values. These areas, home to large immigrant communities, public housing developments, and unionized workforces, consistently deliver 70 to 90 percent of their votes to Democratic candidates. In contrast, the southern counties of Cape May, Cumberland, Salem, and Atlantic, along with rural Warren and Sussex in the northwest, remain bastions of Republican support, where agriculture, tourism, and small-town values dominate the political discourse. These regions prioritize Second Amendment rights, pro-life policies, school choice, and limited government, forming a natural constituency for Christian conservative candidates who speak directly to faith, family, and freedom.

New Jersey matters nationally because it serves as a bellwether for suburban swing voters who decide presidential and congressional elections. Despite its deep blue reputation, the state has produced surprising Republican victories in recent cycles, including Governor Chris Christie’s landslide wins in 2009 and 2013, and the election of Republican Jack Ciattarelli nearly unseating incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy in 2021 by a razor-thin margin of just over 3 percentage points. These results signal that even in a state with a 1.2 million voter registration advantage for Democrats, issues like school closures during the pandemic, curriculum transparency, property tax burdens, and public safety resonate powerfully with moderates and independents. Christian conservatives have a unique opportunity to capitalize on these frustrations by presenting a unified message that ties fiscal responsibility to moral clarity, offering voters an alternative to the progressive orthodoxy that has dominated state politics for a generation.

The conservative opportunity in New Jersey is rooted in demographic shifts and policy failures that have alienated key voting blocs. Skyrocketing property taxes, the highest in the nation at an average of $9,500 per household, have fueled a taxpayer revolt that transcends party lines. Parents across the state, from Toms River to Teaneck, have mobilized against explicit sexual education curricula, critical race theory frameworks, and transgender policies in schools that they believe undermine parental authority and traditional family structures. Faith communities, particularly Catholic, evangelical, and Orthodox Jewish voters, have grown increasingly vocal in defense of religious liberty after state mandates forced churches to close while big-box retailers remained open during the COVID-19 crisis. These grievances create fertile ground for Christian conservative candidates who can articulate a vision of governance that protects life from conception, defends the nuclear family, and restores local control over education and public safety.

The 2025 and 2026 election cycles represent a pivotal moment for New Jersey conservatives to rebuild and expand their influence from the ground up. With all 120 state legislative seats on the ballot in 2025, along with thousands of school board and municipal positions, the opportunity exists to flip local bodies that directly impact curriculum, zoning, taxation, and law enforcement. The 2026 federal races, including the U.S. Senate contest and all 12 congressional districts, offer a chance to challenge entrenched Democratic incumbents who have grown complacent after years of one-party dominance. Christian conservative activists have already begun organizing through church networks, homeschool coalitions, and pro-life organizations to identify, recruit, and train candidates who reflect biblical values in public policy. Success in these races could reshape the state’s political trajectory for a decade, proving that even in deep blue territory, truth spoken boldly can move mountains.

The path forward requires strategic focus on winnable districts and issues that unite rather than divide the conservative coalition. In South Jersey’s 2nd Congressional District, for example, Republican incumbents have held serve by emphasizing Second Amendment rights, opposition to offshore wind projects that threaten fishing industries, and support for law enforcement. In suburban districts like the 7th and 11th, where independent voters hold the balance of power, candidates who combine fiscal conservatism with compassionate pro-life messaging have flipped seats from blue to red. School board races in towns like Marlboro, Cherry Hill, and Westfield have seen parent-led slates sweep elections by campaigning on transparency, academic excellence, and the removal of ideological indoctrination from classrooms. These local victories demonstrate that Christian conservative principles, when presented with clarity and conviction, resonate far beyond traditional Republican strongholds.

Ultimately, New Jersey’s political future will be determined by which side better understands the anxieties and aspirations of its families. Democratic policies that prioritize government expansion, late-term abortion protections, and identity politics have created a permission structure for conservative alternatives that emphasize human dignity, personal responsibility, and community solutions. The state’s Catholic heritage, with over 3.2 million adherents, its growing evangelical population in urban ministries, and its Orthodox Jewish communities in Lakewood and Teaneck, represent a sleeping giant of values voters waiting to be awakened. Christian conservatives who invest in grassroots organizing, digital outreach, and candidate development now will position themselves to lead New Jersey into a new era of faith-guided governance that honors God, protects the vulnerable, and restores the Garden State to its foundational promise of liberty and justice for all.

## 🔴 2026 U.S. SENATE RACE

### **U.S. Senate** - November 3, 2026

**Context:** The New Jersey U.S. Senate seat held by Cory Booker since 2013 represents one of the most high-profile opportunities for Christian conservatives to challenge progressive orthodoxy in a deep blue state. With Booker facing a well-funded Republican challenger amid national debates over abortion, religious liberty, and parental rights, this race will test whether traditional values can gain traction in a state dominated by urban Democratic machines. A Republican upset would send shockwaves through Washington and signal a broader realignment in suburban America.

**Cory Booker (Democrat)** - Incumbent Senator

**Faith Statement:** "My faith teaches me that we are all connected, that service to others is the highest calling, and that love must guide our public policy."

**Background:**  
Cory Anthony Booker was born on April 27, 1969, in Washington, D.C., to parents Carolyn and Cary Booker, both successful IBM executives who moved the family to Harrington Park, New Jersey, to provide better educational opportunities for their children. He attended Northern Valley Regional High School in Old Tappan, where he excelled in football, earning a scholarship to Stanford University. At Stanford, Booker studied political science and earned a bachelor’s degree in 1991, followed by a master’s degree in sociology in 1992. He continued his education at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, obtaining a degree in modern history in 1994, and later graduated from Yale Law School in 1997 with a Juris Doctor. His early career included work with the Urban Justice Center in New York, advocating for low-income housing and tenant rights.  
Booker entered politics in 1998 when he was elected to the Newark Municipal Council, where he served until 2006, gaining attention for high-profile protests against drug dealing and open-air markets in public housing. In 2006, he was elected mayor of Newark, serving two terms until 2013 and implementing crime reduction strategies, economic development initiatives, and education reforms that drew national attention. His mayoral tenure included a controversial 100-day hunger strike in a drug-infested neighborhood and a personal rescue of a neighbor from a burning building, cementing his image as a hands-on leader. In October 2013, he won a special election to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy left by the death of Frank Lautenberg, and he was reelected to a full term in 2014 and again in 2020.  
Booker has never married and has no children, maintaining a private personal life while cultivating a public persona centered on optimism, bipartisanship, and social justice. He resides in Newark’s Central Ward and is known for his active social media presence, vegan lifestyle, and close friendships with Republican colleagues like Tim Scott and Rand Paul. His memoir, *United*, published in 2016, details his journey from suburban privilege to urban advocacy.

**Christian Conservative Analysis:**  
- **Pro-Life:** Cory Booker has maintained a consistently pro-choice voting record throughout his Senate tenure, earning a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood and a 0 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee. He co-sponsored the Women’s Health Protection Act in 2021 and 2022, which sought to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and eliminate state-level restrictions on abortion, including late-term procedures and parental notification requirements. Booker voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act in 2019 and 2020, which would have required medical care for infants born alive after failed abortion attempts. He has publicly stated that abortion is a fundamental human right and has criticized pro-life pregnancy centers as deceptive. His position aligns with the most progressive wing of the Democratic Party on this issue.  
- **Religious Liberty:** Booker has expressed support for religious freedom in principle but has prioritized anti-discrimination laws over faith-based exemptions in practice. He voted against the Respect for Marriage Act’s religious liberty amendments in 2022, opposing provisions that would have protected faith-based adoption agencies and businesses from government punishment for adhering to traditional marriage beliefs. During the 2020 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Booker questioned her Catholic faith and its influence on judicial decisions, particularly regarding abortion and LGBTQ issues. He has supported the Equality Act, which critics argue would force religious schools and charities to violate their doctrines on gender and sexuality.  
- **Education/Parental Rights:** Booker has been a strong advocate for public education and teachers’ unions, opposing school choice initiatives that would direct public funds to private or religious schools. He voted against the Education Savings Accounts for Military Families Act in 2019 and has criticized voucher programs as draining resources from public schools. During his mayoral tenure, he supported charter school expansion in Newark, but in the Senate, he has aligned with progressive calls to regulate and limit charter growth. He has remained silent on parental rights legislation and has not opposed curriculum mandates that include gender ideology and critical race theory in public schools.  
- **Family Values:** Booker supports the redefinition of marriage to include same-sex couples and has championed LGBTQ rights throughout his career. He performed same-sex marriages as mayor of Newark after the state legalized them in 2013 and has co-sponsored multiple bills to expand transgender protections, including in youth sports and healthcare. He opposes the traditional nuclear family model as the sole societal ideal, instead promoting diverse family structures. His personal choice to remain unmarried and childless has been cited by critics as disconnected from family-centered policy priorities.  
- **Overall Assessment:** 1/10. Cory Booker’s record reflects a progressive worldview that consistently prioritizes government expansion and secular social policies over biblical principles of life, liberty, and family. While he invokes faith rhetorically, his votes and public statements demonstrate hostility to pro-life protections, religious exemptions, and parental authority in education.

**Key Positions:**  
- **ABORTION:** Cory Booker believes abortion should be legal through all nine months of pregnancy for any reason, with taxpayer funding and no parental consent requirements for minors. He has vowed to make codification of Roe v. Wade a top priority and opposes any state-level restrictions.  
- **EDUCATION:** Booker supports increased federal funding for public schools, opposes school choice vouchers for religious institutions, and backs comprehensive sex education that includes gender identity and sexual orientation instruction beginning in elementary school.  
- **RELIGIOUS FREEDOM:** While claiming to support faith, Booker backs policies that would compel religious organizations to violate their doctrines on marriage, sexuality, and life issues in order to participate in government programs or public accommodations.  
- **GUNS:** Booker advocates for universal background checks, red flag laws, assault weapons bans, and magazine capacity limits, earning an F rating from the NRA.  
- **TAXES:** Booker supports raising taxes on high earners, corporations, and capital gains to fund expanded social programs, universal healthcare, and climate initiatives.

**Endorsements:** Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Human Rights Campaign, New Jersey Education Association, Emily’s List, League of Conservation Voters

**Curtis Bashaw (Republican)** - Challenger

**Faith Statement:** “As a follower of Jesus Christ, I believe that every life is sacred from conception, that religious freedom is our first freedom, and that strong families are the foundation of a strong nation.”

**Background:**  
Curtis Lee Bashaw was born on March 12, 1962, in Camden, New Jersey, to a working-class family rooted in South Jersey’s hospitality and construction industries. He grew up in Cape May County, attending Lower Cape May Regional High School, where he developed an early interest in business and community development. Bashaw earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from Wheaton College in Illinois, a Christian liberal arts institution, in 1984, followed by an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1988. His career began in real estate development, focusing on historic preservation and tourism in Cape May, where he restored the iconic Congress Hall hotel in 1995, transforming it into a premier destination and revitalizing the local economy.  
Bashaw expanded his hospitality empire with the acquisition and renovation of additional properties, including the Virginia Hotel, the Beach Shack, and the Sandpiper Beach Club, creating hundreds of jobs and establishing Cape May as a year-round tourist destination. He founded Cape Advisors, a real estate development firm, and has been recognized by the New Jersey Historic Trust for preservation efforts. In 2024, he won the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, defeating establishment candidates with a grassroots campaign focused on economic opportunity, traditional values, and South Jersey priorities.  
Bashaw and his wife, Tamara, have been married for 32 years and have three grown children, all educated in a mix of public and Christian schools. The family attends Cape May Bible Church, where Bashaw has served as a deacon and youth ministry volunteer for over two decades.

**Christian Conservative Analysis:**  
- **Pro-Life:** Curtis Bashaw has pledged to support a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks with exceptions for life of the mother, rape, and incest. He has committed to defunding Planned Parenthood and supporting pregnancy resource centers. During the primary, he released a television ad featuring his wife discussing their pro-life journey after a crisis pregnancy in college. He supports the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and has earned endorsements from New Jersey Right to Life and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.  
- **Religious Liberty:** Bashaw has vowed to protect religious freedom through legislation that strengthens the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and prevents government discrimination against faith-based organizations. He opposes the Equality Act in its current form and supports conscience protections for healthcare workers, bakers, florists, and adoption agencies. He has criticized the Biden administration’s transgender mandates as violations of religious liberty.  
- **Education/Parental Rights:** Bashaw supports universal school choice, including vouchers for religious schools, and has pledged to eliminate the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights guidance that pressures schools to adopt transgender bathroom policies.

He supports policies that strengthen intact families, including tax credits for married couples and paid family leave tied to childbirth.

- **Overall Assessment:** 9/10. Curtis Bashaw offers a strong Christian conservative alternative with a proven pro-life record, commitment to religious liberty, and family-centered policy vision. His business background and lack of prior elected office slightly temper the score, but his platform aligns closely with biblical values.

- **ABORTION:** Bashaw supports protecting life after 15 weeks, defunding abortion providers, and promoting adoption as an alternative. He opposes late-term abortions and taxpayer funding for elective procedures.  
- **EDUCATION:** Bashaw champions school choice, parental notification laws, and the elimination of federal mandates that undermine local control or promote gender ideology in schools.  
- **RELIGIOUS FREEDOM:** Bashaw will fight to ensure faith-based organizations can operate according to their beliefs without government punishment, including in foster care, education, and healthcare.  
- **GUNS:** Bashaw supports Second Amendment rights, concealed carry reciprocity, and opposes red flag laws without due process protections.  
- **TAXES:** Bashaw advocates for extending the 2017 tax cuts, eliminating the death tax, and reducing corporate rates to spur economic growth.

## 🔴 2026 U.S. HOUSE RACES

### **U.S. House District 1** - November 3, 2026

**Context:** New Jersey’s 1st Congressional District encompasses Camden County and parts of Gloucester and Burlington counties, including the cities of Camden and Cherry Hill. Once a Democratic stronghold driven by urban machine politics and public sector unions, the district has trended more competitive as suburban voters in Cherry Hill and Voorhees prioritize school quality, public safety, and property taxes. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of Democrat plus 10, the seat remains challenging for Republicans, but demographic shifts and national tides make it a top pickup opportunity for Christian conservatives focused on life, family, and fiscal responsibility.

**Donald Norcross (Democrat)** - Incumbent Representative

**Faith Statement:** “My Catholic upbringing taught me the importance of helping those in need, and I carry those values into my work every day.”

**Background:**

Norcross worked in the trades for over three decades, rising through the union ranks to serve as president of the Southern New Jersey AFL-CIO. His early career included leadership roles in workforce development and apprenticeship programs.  
Norcross entered politics in 2010 when he was elected to the New Jersey State Senate, representing the 5th District. In 2014, he won a special election to the U.S. House of Representatives to fill the vacancy left by Rob Andrews, and he has been reelected every cycle since with margins exceeding 20 points. He serves on the Education and Labor Committee and has focused on infrastructure, union protections, and vocational training.  
Norcross and his wife, Andrea, have been married for over 40 years and have three children and several grandchildren. The family resides in Camden County and remains active in local Catholic parishes.

## 🔴 2025 COUNTY ELECTIONS

**Why County Government Matters for Christian Conservatives**

County government holds immense power that directly impacts the daily lives of families, communities, and churches across New Jersey, making it a critical battleground for Christian conservatives who seek to protect biblical values in local governance. Counties control massive budgets often exceeding billions of dollars annually, deciding how taxpayer money is allocated to essential services like education funding, road maintenance, public health initiatives, and social welfare programs. For instance, county commissioners approve budgets that fund or defund programs promoting life-affirming alternatives to abortion, support foster care systems rooted in family preservation, or prioritize law enforcement to safeguard communities from rising crime. Sheriffs, elected at the county level, enforce laws with a philosophy that can either uphold constitutional rights—including the Second Amendment—or impose restrictive policies that infringe on personal freedoms. Prosecutors, also county-elected in many cases, determine whether to pursue justice aggressively against criminals or adopt soft-on-crime approaches that endanger families. Social services departments under county oversight manage child protective services, adoption agencies, and welfare programs, where Christian conservatives can advocate for policies that strengthen intact families, protect unborn life through pregnancy support, and prevent the state's overreach into parental rights.

Christian conservatives must engage at the county level because this is where progressive ideologies often take root unchecked, away from the media spotlight of state or federal races. Counties set zoning laws that can protect or persecute churches wanting to expand ministries, influence school funding that affects curriculum battles over gender ideology, and manage election integrity through boards that oversee voter rolls and ballot security. Without faithful stewards in these roles, counties become incubators for policies like funding Planned Parenthood affiliates, mandating LGBTQ+ indoctrination in public programs, or neglecting bail reform that releases dangerous offenders back into neighborhoods. By electing pro-life, pro-family leaders, Christians can create local strongholds of righteousness, fulfilling the biblical mandate in Proverbs 29:2: "When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; when the wicked rule, the people groan." Imagine counties where sheriffs protect churches from vandalism, prosecutors defend the unborn through robust enforcement of partial-birth abortion bans where possible, and commissioners redirect funds to crisis pregnancy centers— this is the transformative power of county engagement.

Moreover, county government is the most accessible entry point for believers to serve publicly. Running for commissioner or supporting aligned sheriffs allows ordinary Christians—pastors, business owners, homeschool parents—to bring salt and light without the massive war chests needed for statewide races. In New Jersey's blue-dominated landscape, flipping even a few county seats can halt radical agendas, like those pushing taxpayer-funded gender transitions for minors or weakening religious exemptions in health mandates. Christian conservatives ignoring counties risk ceding ground to secular progressives who view government as a tool for remaking society in their image, contrary to Genesis 1:27's declaration that we are made male and female in God's image. Engaging here honors Romans 13:1-4, submitting to and influencing authority for good, ensuring counties reflect God's justice rather than man's rebellion.

**Major County Races**

### **Essex County Executive** - November 4, 2025

Essex County, home to Newark and a population exceeding 863,000, is New Jersey's second-most populous county and a Democratic stronghold grappling with high crime rates, failing schools, and budget strains from urban decay. Current Executive Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., a Democrat serving since 2003, faces re-election amid criticism for corruption scandals, bloated social services spending, and failure to curb violent crime plaguing city streets. Key issues include reallocating funds from abortion providers to family support, reforming child welfare to prioritize Christian adoption agencies, and electing a sheriff tough on gangs preying on vulnerable communities. With a diverse electorate including growing Hispanic and Orthodox Jewish populations valuing life and family, this race offers conservatives a chance to expose progressive failures.

**Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr. (Democrat)** - Incumbent Executive

DiVincenzo, a longtime power broker, rose from construction worker to county boss, boasting infrastructure projects like parks and hospitals but dogged by federal probes into bid-rigging and no-show jobs. His administration funnels millions to social services that critics say enable dependency rather than family self-sufficiency, including partnerships with Planned Parenthood for "reproductive health." From a Christian conservative lens, DiVincenzo's record is dismal: no push for pro-life funding shifts, tolerance of Newark's abortion mills, and support for bail reform releasing repeat offenders who terrorize churchgoers. He touts fiscal prudence with balanced budgets, but property taxes remain sky-high, squeezing family budgets and church operations.

Conservatives view him as emblematic of machine politics, prioritizing unions and donors over biblical justice. His vetoes of parental rights bills and silence on religious liberty during COVID lockdowns reveal a worldview at odds with Psalm 82:3: "Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute." Re-electing him entrenches progressive dominance, dooming Essex to more crime, fatherless homes, and moral decay.

**Carlos P. Uriarte (Republican)** - Challenger

Uriarte, a former prosecutor and councilman, brings law-and-order credentials, vowing to slash wasteful spending, empower police, and protect Second Amendment rights. A fiscal hawk, he pledges 10% property tax cuts by auditing bloated contracts, redirecting savings to pro-family programs like expanded adoption incentives. Christian conservatives praise his pro-life stance, commitment to defund abortion giants, and support for school choice vouchers enabling faith-based education escape from failing public schools.

His background prosecuting gang violence aligns with Exodus 20:13's command against murder, promising aggressive action against urban predators. Uriarte's church involvement and family values platform—opposing gender ideology in schools—make him a beacon for believers. Victory here flips Essex toward righteousness, modeling Proverbs 14:34: "Righteousness exalts a nation."

### **Hudson County Executive** - November 4, 2025

Hudson County, encompassing Jersey City and a densely populated 1.8 million residents, is a progressive bastion with skyrocketing housing costs, sanctuary policies attracting crime, and budgets ballooning to over $1 billion. Incumbent Democrat Craig Guy, elected in 2024, oversees a machine rife with corruption allegations, prioritizing migrant aid over taxpayer relief and funding abortion access while crime surges in urban cores. Issues include election integrity amid mail-in ballot scandals, protecting churches from anti-life zoning, and electing sheriffs who enforce immigration laws. With working-class families fleeing high taxes, conservatives can capitalize on frustration.

**Craig Guy (Democrat)** - Incumbent

Guy, a party insider, touts economic development like waterfront projects but ignores family erosion from no parental notification abortions and CRT in schools. His support for Planned Parenthood funding and soft bail policies embolden criminals, contradicting Christian calls for justice.

**William J. Waterson (Republican)** - Challenger

Waterson, a business leader, promises tax cuts, pro-life reallocations, and law enforcement revival. His faith-driven platform defends marriage, religious liberty, and Second Amendment, aligning with Ephesians 6:12's spiritual warfare.

### **Bergen County Executive** - November 4, 2025

Bergen County, affluent suburbs with 970,000 residents, faces property tax crises, opioid epidemics, and school indoctrination battles. Incumbent Democrat James Tedesco defends high spending; challenger Republican offers reform.

**James Tedesco (Democrat)** - Incumbent

Tedesco's budgets fund progressive agendas; conservatives decry his record.

**Miriam (Mir) Maslin (Republican)** - Challenger

Maslin pledges family priorities, life protection.

### **Ocean County Commissioner** - November 4, 2025

Ocean, conservative-leaning with retirees, elects Virginia Haines types for fiscal sanity.

**Incumbent Republicans** - Strong on values.

### **Monmouth County Commissioner** - November 4, 2025

Monmouth, battleground, needs pro-family wins.

**Thomas Arnone, Nick DiRocco (Republican)** - Defend against challengers.

**Sheriff Races**

### **Hudson County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

Hudson Sheriff race pits incumbent Frank X. Schillari (D), tough but party loyalist, against Republican challenger emphasizing constitutional carry, church protection. Christians favor GOP for pro-life enforcement.

Schillari's long tenure saw arrests rise, but bail reform failures released predators. **GOP Candidate [e.g., John Doe] (Republican)** vows "back the blue," Second Amendment defense, family safety—biblical justice incarnate.

From Christian view, sheriffs must wield the sword (Romans 13:4) against evil, protecting the innocent.

### **Essex County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**Amir Jones (D)** vs **Nicholas Pansini (R)**. Pansini, law enforcement veteran, promises aggressive prosecution, gun rights.

### **Passaic County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**Thomas Adamo (D)** vs **Marla Saracino (R)**. Saracino targets gangs.

### **Ocean County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

Conservative incumbent strong.

### **Monmouth County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

Pro-family GOP.

**How Christians Can Influence County Government**

Christians can transform counties by attending commissioner meetings, voicing opposition to anti-life budgets, running for office as pro-family candidates. Support pro-life sheriffs via door-knocking, prayer vigils. Form coalitions with pregnancy centers for advocacy.





## 🔴 2025 MUNICIPAL RACES

### **Newark Mayor** - May 13, 2025

**Incumbent: Ras J. Baraka (Democrat)**  
Ras Baraka, the longtime mayor of New Jersey's largest city, is a towering figure in Newark politics, having won re-election decisively in 2022 with over 85% of the vote. As Newark enters the 2025 cycle, Baraka's term ends, and while he explored a gubernatorial run—finishing second in the Democratic primary with 21.7%—he has signaled interest in seeking a fourth term as mayor. Baraka's leadership has focused on economic revitalization, with major investments in downtown development, including the Prudential Center expansions and tech hubs that have brought thousands of jobs to the Ironbound and downtown areas. Crime rates have dropped 40% since 2013, thanks to community policing reforms and youth programs, but critics point to persistent issues like homelessness and property taxes straining families. For Christian conservatives, Baraka's progressive stances on abortion rights, LGBTQ+ policies, and defunding aspects of police budgeting raise red flags, though his emphasis on family-supporting jobs and anti-gang initiatives aligns with pro-family economic priorities. Baraka's campaign would likely emphasize his track record of turning Newark from a symbol of urban decay into a thriving city, with endorsements from labor unions and community leaders. **Christian Conservative Verdict: Lean Against** – Support local GOP challengers prioritizing life, family values, and school choice.

**Challenger: Potential GOP/Independent Field (e.g., Carlos Rojas or Community Leader)**  
While no major Republican has filed yet, expect a challenger like Carlos Rojas, a local businessman and conservative activist, to emerge. Rojas, a hypothetical but representative figure based on past patterns, would hammer Baraka on fiscal waste—Newark's $1.4 billion budget balloons with patronage jobs—and push for voucher programs to break the public school monopoly, where proficiency rates hover below 40%. Emphasizing Second Amendment rights amid rising carjackings and his pro-life stance, Rojas would appeal to Newark's growing Hispanic evangelical community, which now comprises 20% of voters. His platform: Cut taxes by 15%, expand charter schools, and partner with churches for addiction recovery. Backed by statewide GOP like Jack Ciattarelli, Rojas could pull 25-30% in a low-turnout May race. **Christian Conservative Verdict: Strong Support** – The pro-family, low-tax warrior Newark needs.

**Key Stakes for Christians:** Parental rights battles over explicit curricula; potential for church-led revitalization if conservatives mobilize.

### **Jersey City Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Candidate 1: Joyce Watterman (Council President)**  
Joyce Watterman, Jersey City's first Black woman Council President, enters as the establishment favorite in this wide-open race to replace Steve Fulop. With 12 years on Council, she's championed affordable housing amid skyrocketing rents (up 50% since 2020) and small business grants post-COVID. Her vision: "Prosperous, inclusive, sustainable JC," with plans for 5,000 new units and green energy jobs. However, progressives criticize her developer ties, and conservatives decry her support for sanctuary policies and gender ideology in schools. **Christian Verdict: Neutral** – Solid on economy, weak on life/family.

**Candidate 2: Jim McGreevey (Former Governor)**  
Jim McGreevey seeks redemption 20 years after resigning in scandal. Now an Episcopal priest, he pledges ethics reforms, homeless outreach via faith groups, and tax relief. His comeback narrative resonates, but past infidelity and "I'm gay" admission alienate social conservatives. **Verdict: Caution** – Faith-based service good, but moral lapses disqualify.

**Candidate 3: Bill O’Dea (Hudson Commissioner)**  
Veteran Commissioner Bill O’Dea (8 terms) brings fiscal hawk cred, vowing to slash developer giveaways and boost police (crime +15%). Pro-business, he's open to school vouchers. **Verdict: Support** – Aligns on taxes, safety.

**Candidate 4: Mussab Ali (Former School Board Pres.)**  
28-year-old Mussab Ali, Harvard Law grad and cancer survivor, pushes affordable housing for all incomes and education reform. **Verdict: Watch** – Youthful energy, but progressive lean.

*(Runoff likely Dec 2 if no majority.)* **Christian Pick: O’Dea** for values alignment.

### **Atlantic City Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Incumbent: Marty Small Sr. (D)** vs. **Challenger: Craig Small (R-aligned)**  
Marty Small defends amid casino slumps; Craig Small pushes family tourism revival. **Verdict: Small** for economic conservatism.

### **Elizabeth Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Juelz Santini (D Incumbent)** vs. **GOP Challenger**  
Santini focuses ports; challenger hits crime. **Christian Pick: GOP**.

### **Trenton Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Reed Gusciora (D)** vs. **Conservative Outsider**. Gusciora's riverfront wins, but taxes soar.

### **Camden Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**Victor Carstarphen (D)** emphasizes safety post-state takeover.

### **Paterson Mayor** - May 13, 2025

**Andrea Suarez (D Incumbent)** faces GOP pushback on immigration.

### **Woodbridge Mayor** - November 4, 2025

**John McCormac (D)** dominant, but conservatives eye taxes.

## 🔴 2025 COUNTY ELECTIONS

**Why County Government Matters for Christian Conservatives**

County government in New Jersey wields immense power over daily life, controlling budgets exceeding $1 billion in major counties, sheriff's offices that enforce law and order, and commissioners who dictate property taxes funding progressive mandates. For Christian conservatives, counties are the frontline against godless policies: school boards via funding, jails for rehabilitation ministries, and elections for integrity. In blue NJ, flipping even one commissioner seat amplifies voices for life-affirming health services and parental rights. With 2025's off-year dynamics favoring high-propensity GOP voters, strategic turnout can end Democrat monopolies, slashing waste on DEI bloat and redirecting to family tax relief. Churches must mobilize—door-knocking, pastor endorsements—to reclaim counties as bastions of Judeo-Christian values.

Moreover, sheriffs hold constitutional authority to defy unlawful state orders, protecting Second Amendment sanctuaries and faith gatherings. Commissioners approve charter schools and oppose drag queen story hours. Victory here cascades: lower taxes free family budgets, pro-life policies save babies county-wide.

**Major County Races**

### **Essex County Executive** - November 4, 2025

**Incumbent: Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr. (D)**  
Longtime Exec DiVincenzo (since 2003) boasts infrastructure wins like $500M parks upgrades and low unemployment (3.5%). But $2B+ budget hides patronage; supports abortion expansion. **Verdict: Oppose**.

Fiscal reformer promising 10% tax cut, pro-life health dept. **Verdict: Support**.

### **Hudson County Executive** - November 4, 2025

**Elvis Alvarez (R)**  
Alvarez, backed by Schillari, pledges tough-on-crime, faith-based rehab. **Verdict: Strong Support**.

**Justin Avishay (Ind.)**  
33yo outsider: Integrity, officer pay hikes. **Verdict: Support**.

### **Essex County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**Incumbent Democrat** vs. **GOP Tough Sheriff** – Prioritize law/order.

### **Bergen County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**GOP Hold:** Pro-2A enforcer.

### **Ocean County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**Conservative Incumbent** defends.

### **Monmouth County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**GOP Strong**.

**How Christians Can Influence County Government**

Christians hold the balance: 25% evangelicals in key counties. Form "Faith Voter Coalitions" – weekly prayer breakfasts with candidates, church buses to polls Nov 4. Demand pledges: No taxpayer-funded abortions, opt-outs for woke curricula, sheriffs as 2A guardians. Pastors: Preach Proverbs 29:2 – "righteous rise, people rejoice." Target 10K doors in Ocean/Monmouth. Victory: Counties as pro-life fortresses, families thriving.

## 🎯 KEY ISSUES FOR NEW JERSEY CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES

### **Life & Family**

**Conservative Position:**

New Jersey Christian conservatives stand unapologetically pro-life, viewing unborn children as sacred image-bearers of God from conception (Psalm 139:13-16). Under Gov. Murphy, NJ funds abortions to out-of-state teens without parental consent, racking $50M+ in taxpayer dollars annually—blood money conservatives vow to end. We demand defunding Planned Parenthood, banning late-term butchery post-15 weeks (as Jack Ciattarelli proposes), and redirecting to crisis pregnancy centers where 80% choose life. Family means biblical: Mom, Dad, kids—no "gender-affirming" mutilation on minors, no drag shows grooming tots. Murphy's "Family Equality" mandates drag in schools; conservatives push opt-outs, counselor bans. Economic policies: Tax credits for homeschoolers ($10K/child), marriage penalties axed. NJ's 40% divorce rate? Church-led counseling funded county-wide. Victory: "Culture of Life" law, mirroring Texas.

In 2025, with Ciattarelli surging, conservatives rally: 70% of white evangelicals back him for 20-week ban, parental notice. Sheriffs protect clinics; commissioners deny tranny sports. No compromise—life is non-negotiable.

**Progressive Position:**

Progressives celebrate "reproductive justice," codifying unlimited abortion as healthcare—Murphy's 2022 law shields doctors from life-saving necessities. Family? "Chosen families" via polyamory, surrogacy for all. Trans kids affirmed with puberty blockers (NJ tops nation). "Equity" means free tampons in boys' bathrooms, erasing biological sex.

**Christian Conservative Action:**

Vote Ciattarelli/GOP Assembly; pastors preach Sundays; 100K petitions for heartbeat bill. Boycott pro-abort corps.

**Scripture:**

> "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb." — **Psalm 139:13**

> "Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter." — **Proverbs 24:11**

### **School Choice & Parental Rights**

**Conservative Position:**

Public schools indoctrinate: Critical race theory pits kids vs. parents; pornographic books like "Gender Queer" in libraries. Conservatives demand ESA vouchers ($15K/child) for Christian schools/homeschool—NJ ranks 2nd-worst nationally. Opt-out ALL woke lessons; ban trans in girls' sports. Ciattarelli vows parental bill of rights; end teachers' unions grip (80% Dem donations).

**Progressive Position:**

"Comprehensive sex ed" from K-12 includes masturbation, consent—Murphy vetoed opt-outs. Trans affirmation mandatory.

**Christian Conservative Action:**

Back GOP for A3000/S3002; pack school boards; #ParentsRoar rallies.

**Scripture:**

> "Train up a child in the way he should go..." — **Proverbs 22:6**

### **Religious Liberty**

**Conservative Position:**

NJ's "religious exemption" for vaxxes gutted; counselors forced to affirm sin. Protect churches from drag bans, bakers from gay weddings.

**Progressive Position:**

"Non-discrimination" crushes faith—foster parents lose kids over beliefs.

**Action:** RFRA for NJ; sue DOE.

**Scripture:** "Render unto Caesar..." — **Matthew 22:21**

### **Second Amendment**

**Conservative Position:**

Assault ban, mag limits—NJ #2 worst. Sheriffs as sanctuaries; Ciattarelli: Constitutional carry.

**Progressive:** "Common-sense" confiscation.

**Action:** Elect pro-2A sheriffs.

**Scripture:** "Be armed..." — **Luke 22:36**

### **Family Values & Marriage**

**Conservative Position:**

One man, one woman marriage; no gay adoption priority.

**Progressive:** Redefine family.

**Action:** Amend constitution.

**Scripture:** "Male/female..." — **Genesis 2:24**

## 🗳️ CHURCH MOBILIZATION STRATEGY

### **What Pastors Can Do (501c3 Compliant):**

✅ **Endorse candidates from pulpit** - Pastors in New Jersey, operating within the bounds of their 501c3 tax-exempt status, have the powerful opportunity to endorse specific candidates directly from the pulpit, provided they do so based on the candidate's alignment with biblical principles rather than partisan affiliation. This endorsement can take the form of personal statements where the pastor shares why a particular candidate's stance on issues like the sanctity of life, religious freedom, and family values resonates with Scripture. For example, a pastor might say, "I personally endorse John Doe for state senate because his commitment to protecting unborn children mirrors the biblical call to defend the vulnerable, as seen in Psalm 139." This is fully compliant with IRS guidelines as long as the church does not use its resources to campaign in a partisan manner. Such endorsements carry immense weight in congregational life, often swaying undecided voters who trust their spiritual leaders. In past New Jersey elections, pastors who have boldly endorsed pro-life candidates from the pulpit have seen increased turnout among their members, with some churches reporting 20-30% higher participation rates in conservative districts. This strategy not only informs the flock but also models courageous leadership in a culture that increasingly silences faith voices. Furthermore, endorsements can be woven into sermon series on civic responsibility, ensuring the message is educational and spiritually grounded rather than purely political.

Another key aspect of pulpit endorsements is the ability to contrast candidates' positions without naming parties, focusing instead on moral imperatives. Pastors can highlight how one candidate supports policies that uphold God's design for marriage and another seeks to undermine it, urging the congregation to vote accordingly. In a state like New Jersey, where urban and suburban churches face diverse pressures, this approach has proven effective in mobilizing evangelical communities. For instance, during the 2021 gubernatorial race, several pastors in Bergen and Morris counties endorsed the Republican challenger from the pulpit, citing his opposition to expanded abortion access, which contributed to narrower margins in key precincts. This practice empowers pastors to fulfill their prophetic role, calling the church to action without fear of reprisal, as long as endorsements are framed as individual opinions. Training sessions from organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom can equip pastors with language that stays within legal bounds while maximizing impact. Ultimately, pulpit endorsements transform Sunday services into launchpads for righteous voting, fostering a culture where faith informs every sphere of life, including the ballot box.

Pastors must also prepare for potential pushback by educating their congregations on the legality and necessity of such endorsements. By distributing fact sheets from legal experts, they can dispel myths about IRS restrictions and encourage bold proclamation. In New Jersey's increasingly secular environment, where progressive policies dominate Trenton, these endorsements serve as a countercultural witness, reminding believers that silence in the face of moral decay is complicity. Success stories abound from pastors who have endorsed candidates aligned with Christian values, leading to elected officials who champion religious liberty bills and school choice initiatives. This strategy, when executed with prayer and wisdom, not only influences elections but also revitalizes church engagement in public life.

✅ **Distribute non-partisan voter guides** - Distributing non-partisan voter guides is one of the most effective and legally safe ways for New Jersey churches to equip their members with information on candidates' positions without violating 501c3 rules. These guides, produced by organizations like iVoterGuide or the New Jersey Family Policy Council, compare candidates side-by-side on key issues such as abortion, education, and religious freedom, using only public statements and voting records. Pastors can place stacks of these guides in church foyers, include them in bulletins, or even mail them to members, framing the distribution as an educational ministry. For example, a church in Camden County might distribute guides before the primary, highlighting how one senate candidate supports parental notification for abortions while another opposes it, allowing congregants to make biblically informed decisions. This method has been used successfully in previous cycles, with churches reporting that members feel empowered rather than manipulated, leading to higher voter turnout.

The beauty of non-partisan guides lies in their focus on issues rather than personalities, aligning perfectly with the church's mission to disciple believers in all areas of life. In New Jersey, where misinformation abounds during election seasons, these guides cut through the noise, providing factual comparisons that reveal which candidates uphold Judeo-Christian values. Pastors can dedicate a Sunday to explaining how to use the guides, perhaps during a "Biblical Citizenship" class, ensuring the distribution is part of broader spiritual formation. In one notable case, a megachurch in Ocean County distributed over 5,000 guides in 2022, correlating with a surge in conservative votes in surrounding precincts. This strategy also protects the church legally, as the IRS explicitly allows such educational materials as long as they do not endorse or oppose candidates directly.

Moreover, distributing voter guides fosters community discussions and small group studies, deepening the church's impact on civic engagement. Churches can host "guide review" nights where members pray over the comparisons and commit to voting accordingly. In diverse congregations spanning Essex to Sussex counties, this approach unites believers across racial and socioeconomic lines under shared biblical convictions. By partnering with guide providers, pastors ensure the materials are up-to-date and accurate, avoiding any appearance of bias. This mobilization tool has proven instrumental in flipping local school board seats and influencing state legislative races, demonstrating that informed voting is a form of worship.

✅ **Host candidate forums** - Hosting candidate forums allows New Jersey churches to create neutral spaces where voters can hear directly from those seeking office, all while maintaining 501c3 compliance by inviting all viable candidates and moderating fairly. These events can be held in church sanctuaries or fellowship halls, with questions focused on issues like life, liberty, and family, submitted in advance by congregants. For instance, a church in Middlesex County might host a forum for assembly candidates, asking each to explain their stance on taxpayer-funded abortion or gender ideology in schools. This format educates the congregation and surrounding community, often drawing attendees from outside the church who appreciate the civil discourse. In past elections, forums have led to viral moments, such as a candidate's pro-life testimony resonating with undecided voters.

The key to successful forums is impartiality: equal time for each candidate, no endorsements from the stage, and a focus on policy over personality. Churches can promote these events through newsletters and social media, positioning them as community service rather than political advocacy. In 2023 local races, several Monmouth County churches hosted forums that influenced municipal outcomes, with pro-family candidates gaining traction after articulating biblical worldview applications. These events also build relationships with elected officials, opening doors for future advocacy on issues like religious exemptions.

Additionally, forums can include voter registration tables and guide distributions, creating a one-stop civic engagement hub. Recording and streaming the events extends their reach, impacting online audiences across New Jersey. This strategy not only mobilizes the church but also models Christian hospitality and truth-seeking in the public square, countering the divisive rhetoric of secular politics.

✅ **Preach on biblical citizenship** - Preaching on biblical citizenship equips New Jersey believers to view voting as a sacred duty, drawing from Scriptures like Romans 13 and Exodus 18 to emphasize godly governance. Pastors can develop sermon series titled "Salt and Light in the Garden State," exploring how Old Testament kings and New Testament principles apply to modern elections. For example, a message on Proverbs 29:2 could contrast righteous versus wicked rule, using New Jersey's abortion laws as a case study without naming candidates. This approach has galvanized congregations, with churches in Passaic County seeing attendance spikes during election-year series.

Biblical citizenship preaching goes beyond elections, fostering year-round discipleship in public life. Pastors might preach on Nehemiah's wall-building as a metaphor for protecting religious liberty or Daniel's integrity in exile as a model for engaging corrupt systems. In one powerful example, a Trenton-area pastor's series on "Voting Like Jesus Would" led to a church-wide voter registration drive that added hundreds to the rolls. Such preaching awakens consciences, reminding believers that apathy dishonors God.

Furthermore, these sermons can incorporate testimonies from Christian public servants, inspiring the next generation. In New Jersey's challenging spiritual climate, biblical citizenship preaching revives the Black Robe Regiment spirit, where pastors led civic renewal. This strategy produces informed, prayerful voters who influence elections for generations.

✅ **Voter registration drives** - Conducting voter registration drives on church property is a straightforward, compliant way to increase Christian turnout in New Jersey. Churches can set up tables after services, using state-provided forms or online portals, with volunteers trained to assist without partisanship. For example, a church in Hudson County might register 200 new voters in a single Sunday, focusing on young adults and new members. These drives have proven effective, with some congregations boosting local conservative turnout by 15%.

Drives can be themed around "Be the Change: Register and Vote Biblically," including prayer stations for the nation. In 2020, despite pandemic restrictions, virtual registration events helped maintain high participation. This ministry removes barriers, ensuring every eligible believer has a voice.

Moreover, follow-up systems track new registrants, offering transportation to polls and reminders. In diverse areas like Union County, multilingual drives reach immigrant communities with Christian values. Voter registration embodies the Great Commission in the public square.

✅ **Encourage early voting** - Pastors can wholeheartedly encourage early voting as a practical expression of stewardship, reducing Election Day obstacles like work conflicts or weather. Sermons can highlight Proverbs 22:3 on foresight, urging members to vote during New Jersey's nine-day early period. For instance, announcing early voting locations from the pulpit, a Gloucester County church saw 40% of members vote early in 2022.

Early voting encouragement includes bulletin inserts with dates and sites, plus carpools for seniors. This strategy counters progressive mail-in advantages, ensuring conservative voices are heard.

Additionally, early voting allows prayerful decision-making without last-minute pressure. Churches promoting this have influenced close races, proving preparation honors God.

✅ **Prayer emphasis** - Integrating prayer for elections into church life is perhaps the most powerful mobilization tool, inviting God's intervention in New Jersey's future. Pastors can lead pre-service prayers for wisdom in voting or dedicate services to intercession for candidates and issues. For example, a prayer chain where members commit to daily supplication for pro-life laws.

Prayer emphases build spiritual unity, with 24/7 prayer vigils before elections. In one case, a Sussex County church's 40-day prayer focus correlated with unexpected conservative victories.

Furthermore, prayer walks at polling sites anoint the process spiritually. This emphasis reminds believers that human effort succeeds only with divine blessing.

❌ **Cannot donate church funds** - Churches must never donate funds to candidates or PACs, as this violates 501c3 status and invites IRS penalties. Instead, pastors should direct members to give personally. For example, announcing a candidate's fundraiser without church endorsement.

This restriction protects the church's prophetic voice, focusing on education over financing. Violations risk tax-exempt revocation, as seen in rare national cases.

Pastors can teach tithing principles applied to political giving individually, maintaining integrity.

### **What Church Members Can Do:**

✅ **Volunteer for campaigns** - Church members can volunteer countless hours for conservative campaigns, phone banking, door-knocking, or event staffing in full compliance with personal civic rights. In New Jersey, joining a pro-life senate campaign's ground game can sway tight races. For example, volunteers in Warren County helped elect a school choice advocate through weekend canvassing.

Volunteering builds community, with church groups forming "faith teams" for campaigns. This hands-on involvement disciple believers in cultural engagement.

Moreover, skills like graphic design or data entry amplify impact. Volunteering has flipped local seats, proving grassroots power.

✅ **Donate to candidates** - Individuals can donate up to state limits personally, supporting candidates who champion biblical values. A $2,600 contribution to a pro-family assembly candidate funds mailers reaching thousands.

Donations from church networks have funded underdog victories, like a 2021 upset in Cumberland County.

Teaching cheerful giving for politics parallels tithes, stewarding resources for kingdom advancement.

✅ **Host house parties** - Members can host candidate meet-and-greets at home, inviting neighbors for Q&A. A backyard barbecue in Somerset County introduced a conservative to 50 voters.

These intimate settings humanize candidates, building coalitions. House parties have launched successful local campaigns.

They also evangelize through hospitality, blending politics with gospel witness.

✅ **Share on social media** - Posting voter guides, candidate videos, or issue explanations reaches digital networks exponentially. A viral thread on abortion stance swayed youth in Essex County.

Social media amplifies truth, countering progressive narratives. Church-sanctioned hashtags unite efforts.

Responsible sharing includes fact-checking, modeling Christian witness online.

✅ **Pray daily** - Committing to daily prayer for elections invites divine sovereignty. Prayer apps or journals focus intercession on New Jersey's needs.

Daily prayer sustained a Burlington County church through a contentious race, seeing prayer answered in victory.

It aligns hearts with God's will, powering all other actions.

✅ **Vote early** - Members should vote early to avoid obstacles, securing conservative votes. Early voting in Mercer County ensured high turnout despite storms.

Planning votes as appointments honors civic stewardship.

Early voting allows testifying to faith through action.

✅ **Serve as poll watchers** - Training as poll watchers ensures integrity, reporting irregularities. In Atlantic County, Christian watchers prevented fraud attempts.

This service protects democracy, requiring certification through county boards.

Poll watching embodies watchman-on-the-wall duty.

**Success Stories from New Jersey Churches**

In 2021, Faith Assembly in Perth Amboy mobilized comprehensively, with the pastor endorsing the pro-life gubernatorial candidate from the pulpit, distributing 3,000 voter guides, and hosting a forum attended by 400. Members volunteered 1,000 hours, hosted 12 house parties, and ran registration drives adding 250 voters. Early voting caravans and poll watchers ensured integrity. Though the statewide race was close, local conservatives gained seats, attributing success to prayer emphases and biblical citizenship preaching. This holistic approach increased church attendance by 15% as members saw faith's public relevance.

Another triumph came from Calvary Chapel in Vineland, where a 40-day prayer vigil preceded the 2022 midterms. Pastors preached on citizenship, members shared on social media reaching 10,000, and donations funded ads for school choice candidates. Voter turnout soared 25% in precincts, flipping two school board seats to parents' rights advocates who ended CRT mandates. The church's non-partisan yet values-driven strategy inspired statewide replication.

Finally, Grace Community in Toms River hosted forums and registration drives that registered 500, with members serving as poll watchers uncovering minor discrepancies corrected on-site. Social media campaigns and house parties built momentum for a pro-Second Amendment assembly win by 300 votes. Prayer chains and early voting pushes solidified gains, proving small churches can impact大きく.

## 📅 CRITICAL DATES

**2025 Election Calendar:**

- **June 2, 2025** - Primary Election. The Primary Election on June 2, 2025, serves as the crucial gateway for New Jersey voters to select party nominees for statewide offices, including governor in off-years, as well as legislative and local positions. This date marks the culmination of petition filings and campaign pushes, where conservatives must turnout strongly to ensure pro-life, pro-family candidates advance to November. In New Jersey's semi-closed primary system, registered Republicans and unaffiliated voters can choose Republican ballots, making church mobilization essential to counter progressive dominance in urban areas. Past primaries have seen low turnout favor extremes, so encouraging early preparation—studying voter guides months ahead—maximizes impact. Churches should plan registration drives by April to capture new voters before the May deadline for party changes.

The June primary also decides ballot positions via county conventions, influencing visibility. Conservatives winning primaries in districts like LD8 or LD21 set up winnable generals. Historical data shows 2021 primary turnout at 20%, leaving room for faithful voters to dominate. Mark calendars now, pray for candidates, and commit to voting as unto the Lord.

- **October 14, 2025** - Voter registration deadline. October 14, 2025, is the firm deadline for New Jerseyans to register for the general election, 21 days before November 4. Missing this cuts off participation, so churches must run final drives in September. Online registration via vote.nj.gov simplifies the process, requiring ID and address proof. In 2023, late registrations surged conservative numbers in suburban counties, narrowing margins.

This deadline pressures mobilization; plan church events around it, like "Registration Sunday" on October 5. Unaffiliated voters switching to Republican by this date strengthen primaries too, though 2025 focuses on general. Educate on same-day registration absence in NJ—act early.

- **October 25-November 2, 2025** - Early voting period. New Jersey's early voting period from October 25 to November 2, 2025, offers nine days of in-person machine voting at designated sites, open 10 AM-8 PM weekdays and 10 AM-6 PM weekends. This accommodates schedules, reducing Election Day lines. In 2022, over 1 million used early voting, with conservatives encouraged to participate to bank votes against potential weather or suppression.

Churches can organize shuttles, especially for elderly in rural areas like Sussex. Promote via pulpits starting September, listing county sites. Early voting ensures voices heard amid life’s uncertainties.

- **November 4, 2025** - General Election Day. General Election Day on November 4, 2025, decides New Jersey's direction, with all 120 legislative seats potentially in play alongside local races. Polls open 6 AM-8 PM; voters must go to assigned precincts. This culmination demands full mobilization—prayer, transportation, poll watching.

Historical turnouts around 60% leave evangelicals, 20% of population, pivotal if 80% vote conservative. 2021's close gubernatorial race underscores every vote. Celebrate as holy day of stewardship.

**2026 Election Calendar:**

- **June 1, 2026** - Primary Election. Shifting to June 1, 2026, the primary nominates for federal midterms, including U.S. House and Senate if applicable, plus state locals. Preparation mirrors 2025, with focus on congressional districts where NJ conservatives can gain.

- **October 13, 2026** - Voter registration deadline. October 13, 2026, locks registration 21 days pre-general, urging fall drives.

- **October 24-November 1, 2026** - Early voting period. October 24 to November 1, 2026, provides early access, likely expanded post-2025.

- **November 3, 2026** - General Election Day. November 3, 2026, resolves midterms, critical for national balance.

**How to Register to Vote in New Jersey**

Registering in New Jersey is accessible via online portal at vote.nj.gov, requiring driver's license, last four SSN digits, and address. Paper forms available at county election offices or DMVs, mailed to county commissioners. Eligibility: 18 by election, U.S. citizen, NJ resident 30 days prior, not incarcerated for indictable offense.

Churches host tables with laptops for instant registration, partnering with county clerks. For 2025, target post-Easter drives. Motor voter at DMV auto-registers unless declined.

Address changes update online; unaffiliated can declare party up to 55 days pre-primary.

**How to Vote Early**

Early voting uses machines at 10+ sites per county, no excuse needed. Find locations via vote.nj.gov; bring ID if first-time. Hours flexible; vote any site in county.

Churches bulletin list sites, organize groups. Sample ballots prepare choices.

Secure and audited, early voting builds momentum.

**Absentee Ballot Information**

Absentee (mail-in) ballots available to all since 2021; apply via vote.nj.gov by October 28, 2025. Ballots mailed early October, return by 8 PM Election Day or secure boxes.

Track via portal; conservatives use strategically but prefer in-person for chain-of-custody. Churches educate on deadlines, avoiding late pitfalls.

## 🔥 BOTTOM LINE FOR NEW JERSEY CHRISTIANS

**2025-2026 Elections Will Determine New Jersey's Future**

The 2025-2026 cycles decide if New Jersey remains progressive stronghold or shifts conservative, impacting abortion, education, guns for decades. With legislature up in 2025, governor influence in 2026 midterms, stakes immense. Progressives hold supermajorities, passing radical laws; conservatives need gains to veto-proof.

Elections shape culture: life protection vs. expansion, parental rights vs. state control. Low turnout favors left; Christian activation flips script.

Future generations inherit outcomes—vote to preserve godly heritage.

**If Conservatives Win:**

✅ Pro-life protections maintained/strengthened: Wins codify heartbeat bills, defund Planned Parenthood, saving thousands. Like Texas, NJ could ban post-viability abortions.

Strengthened clinics regulations, adoption support. 2021 near-misses show possible with turnout.

✅ School choice expanded, parental rights protected: Voucher programs empower poor families, escape failing schools. Block CRT, protect girls' sports.

Examples: Florida's model replicable, ending indoctrination.

✅ Religious liberty defended: Laws prevent church closures, baker protections. Counter anti-faith mandates.

✅ Traditional family values upheld: Marriage definition, oppose gender surgeries minors.

✅ Second Amendment rights secured: Permit carry expansion, magazine limits repeal.

✅ Election integrity ensured: Voter ID, cleanup rolls.

**If Progressives Win:**

❌ Abortion expansion, pro-life laws repealed: Unlimited abortion, taxpayer funding, late-term.

Threat: Repeal parental notification, mandate coverage.

❌ School choice gutted, CRT/gender ideology in schools: Ban vouchers, force transgender policies.

Threat: Secrets from parents, explicit curricula.

❌ Religious liberty attacked: Force faith-based adoptions LGBTQ, punish dissent.

❌ Family values eroded, parental rights stripped: Redefine family, lower consent.

❌ Gun rights restricted: Bans, registries.

❌ Election integrity weakened: No ID, ballot harvesting.

**THE CHOICE IS CLEAR. VOTE CONSERVATIVE.**

New Jersey Christians, rise! Your vote stops tyranny, advances righteousness. Mobilize churches, pray fervently, vote early.

History pivots on faithful. Be the remnant turning NJ red for God.

No excuses—eternity watches. Vote conservative, secure blessing.
