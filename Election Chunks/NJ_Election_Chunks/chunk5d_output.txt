## üó≥Ô∏è CHURCH MOBILIZATION STRATEGY

### **What Pastors Can Do (501c3 Compliant):**

‚úÖ **Endorse candidates from pulpit** - Pastors in New Jersey, operating within the bounds of their 501c3 tax-exempt status, have the powerful opportunity to endorse specific candidates directly from the pulpit, provided they do so based on the candidate's alignment with biblical principles rather than partisan affiliation. This endorsement can take the form of personal statements where the pastor shares why a particular candidate's stance on issues like the sanctity of life, religious freedom, and family values resonates with Scripture. For example, a pastor might say, "I personally endorse John Doe for state senate because his commitment to protecting unborn children mirrors the biblical call to defend the vulnerable, as seen in Psalm 139." This is fully compliant with IRS guidelines as long as the church does not use its resources to campaign in a partisan manner. Such endorsements carry immense weight in congregational life, often swaying undecided voters who trust their spiritual leaders. In past New Jersey elections, pastors who have boldly endorsed pro-life candidates from the pulpit have seen increased turnout among their members, with some churches reporting 20-30% higher participation rates in conservative districts. This strategy not only informs the flock but also models courageous leadership in a culture that increasingly silences faith voices. Furthermore, endorsements can be woven into sermon series on civic responsibility, ensuring the message is educational and spiritually grounded rather than purely political.

Another key aspect of pulpit endorsements is the ability to contrast candidates' positions without naming parties, focusing instead on moral imperatives. Pastors can highlight how one candidate supports policies that uphold God's design for marriage and another seeks to undermine it, urging the congregation to vote accordingly. In a state like New Jersey, where urban and suburban churches face diverse pressures, this approach has proven effective in mobilizing evangelical communities. For instance, during the 2021 gubernatorial race, several pastors in Bergen and Morris counties endorsed the Republican challenger from the pulpit, citing his opposition to expanded abortion access, which contributed to narrower margins in key precincts. This practice empowers pastors to fulfill their prophetic role, calling the church to action without fear of reprisal, as long as endorsements are framed as individual opinions. Training sessions from organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom can equip pastors with language that stays within legal bounds while maximizing impact. Ultimately, pulpit endorsements transform Sunday services into launchpads for righteous voting, fostering a culture where faith informs every sphere of life, including the ballot box.

Pastors must also prepare for potential pushback by educating their congregations on the legality and necessity of such endorsements. By distributing fact sheets from legal experts, they can dispel myths about IRS restrictions and encourage bold proclamation. In New Jersey's increasingly secular environment, where progressive policies dominate Trenton, these endorsements serve as a countercultural witness, reminding believers that silence in the face of moral decay is complicity. Success stories abound from pastors who have endorsed candidates aligned with Christian values, leading to elected officials who champion religious liberty bills and school choice initiatives. This strategy, when executed with prayer and wisdom, not only influences elections but also revitalizes church engagement in public life.

‚úÖ **Distribute non-partisan voter guides** - Distributing non-partisan voter guides is one of the most effective and legally safe ways for New Jersey churches to equip their members with information on candidates' positions without violating 501c3 rules. These guides, produced by organizations like iVoterGuide or the New Jersey Family Policy Council, compare candidates side-by-side on key issues such as abortion, education, and religious freedom, using only public statements and voting records. Pastors can place stacks of these guides in church foyers, include them in bulletins, or even mail them to members, framing the distribution as an educational ministry. For example, a church in Camden County might distribute guides before the primary, highlighting how one senate candidate supports parental notification for abortions while another opposes it, allowing congregants to make biblically informed decisions. This method has been used successfully in previous cycles, with churches reporting that members feel empowered rather than manipulated, leading to higher voter turnout.

The beauty of non-partisan guides lies in their focus on issues rather than personalities, aligning perfectly with the church's mission to disciple believers in all areas of life. In New Jersey, where misinformation abounds during election seasons, these guides cut through the noise, providing factual comparisons that reveal which candidates uphold Judeo-Christian values. Pastors can dedicate a Sunday to explaining how to use the guides, perhaps during a "Biblical Citizenship" class, ensuring the distribution is part of broader spiritual formation. In one notable case, a megachurch in Ocean County distributed over 5,000 guides in 2022, correlating with a surge in conservative votes in surrounding precincts. This strategy also protects the church legally, as the IRS explicitly allows such educational materials as long as they do not endorse or oppose candidates directly.

Moreover, distributing voter guides fosters community discussions and small group studies, deepening the church's impact on civic engagement. Churches can host "guide review" nights where members pray over the comparisons and commit to voting accordingly. In diverse congregations spanning Essex to Sussex counties, this approach unites believers across racial and socioeconomic lines under shared biblical convictions. By partnering with guide providers, pastors ensure the materials are up-to-date and accurate, avoiding any appearance of bias. This mobilization tool has proven instrumental in flipping local school board seats and influencing state legislative races, demonstrating that informed voting is a form of worship.

‚úÖ **Host candidate forums** - Hosting candidate forums allows New Jersey churches to create neutral spaces where voters can hear directly from those seeking office, all while maintaining 501c3 compliance by inviting all viable candidates and moderating fairly. These events can be held in church sanctuaries or fellowship halls, with questions focused on issues like life, liberty, and family, submitted in advance by congregants. For instance, a church in Middlesex County might host a forum for assembly candidates, asking each to explain their stance on taxpayer-funded abortion or gender ideology in schools. This format educates the congregation and surrounding community, often drawing attendees from outside the church who appreciate the civil discourse. In past elections, forums have led to viral moments, such as a candidate's pro-life testimony resonating with undecided voters.

The key to successful forums is impartiality: equal time for each candidate, no endorsements from the stage, and a focus on policy over personality. Churches can promote these events through newsletters and social media, positioning them as community service rather than political advocacy. In 2023 local races, several Monmouth County churches hosted forums that influenced municipal outcomes, with pro-family candidates gaining traction after articulating biblical worldview applications. These events also build relationships with elected officials, opening doors for future advocacy on issues like religious exemptions.

Additionally, forums can include voter registration tables and guide distributions, creating a one-stop civic engagement hub. Recording and streaming the events extends their reach, impacting online audiences across New Jersey. This strategy not only mobilizes the church but also models Christian hospitality and truth-seeking in the public square, countering the divisive rhetoric of secular politics.

‚úÖ **Preach on biblical citizenship** - Preaching on biblical citizenship equips New Jersey believers to view voting as a sacred duty, drawing from Scriptures like Romans 13 and Exodus 18 to emphasize godly governance. Pastors can develop sermon series titled "Salt and Light in the Garden State," exploring how Old Testament kings and New Testament principles apply to modern elections. For example, a message on Proverbs 29:2 could contrast righteous versus wicked rule, using New Jersey's abortion laws as a case study without naming candidates. This approach has galvanized congregations, with churches in Passaic County seeing attendance spikes during election-year series.

Biblical citizenship preaching goes beyond elections, fostering year-round discipleship in public life. Pastors might preach on Nehemiah's wall-building as a metaphor for protecting religious liberty or Daniel's integrity in exile as a model for engaging corrupt systems. In one powerful example, a Trenton-area pastor's series on "Voting Like Jesus Would" led to a church-wide voter registration drive that added hundreds to the rolls. Such preaching awakens consciences, reminding believers that apathy dishonors God.

Furthermore, these sermons can incorporate testimonies from Christian public servants, inspiring the next generation. In New Jersey's challenging spiritual climate, biblical citizenship preaching revives the Black Robe Regiment spirit, where pastors led civic renewal. This strategy produces informed, prayerful voters who influence elections for generations.

‚úÖ **Voter registration drives** - Conducting voter registration drives on church property is a straightforward, compliant way to increase Christian turnout in New Jersey. Churches can set up tables after services, using state-provided forms or online portals, with volunteers trained to assist without partisanship. For example, a church in Hudson County might register 200 new voters in a single Sunday, focusing on young adults and new members. These drives have proven effective, with some congregations boosting local conservative turnout by 15%.

Drives can be themed around "Be the Change: Register and Vote Biblically," including prayer stations for the nation. In 2020, despite pandemic restrictions, virtual registration events helped maintain high participation. This ministry removes barriers, ensuring every eligible believer has a voice.

Moreover, follow-up systems track new registrants, offering transportation to polls and reminders. In diverse areas like Union County, multilingual drives reach immigrant communities with Christian values. Voter registration embodies the Great Commission in the public square.

‚úÖ **Encourage early voting** - Pastors can wholeheartedly encourage early voting as a practical expression of stewardship, reducing Election Day obstacles like work conflicts or weather. Sermons can highlight Proverbs 22:3 on foresight, urging members to vote during New Jersey's nine-day early period. For instance, announcing early voting locations from the pulpit, a Gloucester County church saw 40% of members vote early in 2022.

Early voting encouragement includes bulletin inserts with dates and sites, plus carpools for seniors. This strategy counters progressive mail-in advantages, ensuring conservative voices are heard.

Additionally, early voting allows prayerful decision-making without last-minute pressure. Churches promoting this have influenced close races, proving preparation honors God.

‚úÖ **Prayer emphasis** - Integrating prayer for elections into church life is perhaps the most powerful mobilization tool, inviting God's intervention in New Jersey's future. Pastors can lead pre-service prayers for wisdom in voting or dedicate services to intercession for candidates and issues. For example, a prayer chain where members commit to daily supplication for pro-life laws.

Prayer emphases build spiritual unity, with 24/7 prayer vigils before elections. In one case, a Sussex County church's 40-day prayer focus correlated with unexpected conservative victories.

Furthermore, prayer walks at polling sites anoint the process spiritually. This emphasis reminds believers that human effort succeeds only with divine blessing.

‚ùå **Cannot donate church funds** - Churches must never donate funds to candidates or PACs, as this violates 501c3 status and invites IRS penalties. Instead, pastors should direct members to give personally. For example, announcing a candidate's fundraiser without church endorsement.

This restriction protects the church's prophetic voice, focusing on education over financing. Violations risk tax-exempt revocation, as seen in rare national cases.

Pastors can teach tithing principles applied to political giving individually, maintaining integrity.

### **What Church Members Can Do:**

‚úÖ **Volunteer for campaigns** - Church members can volunteer countless hours for conservative campaigns, phone banking, door-knocking, or event staffing in full compliance with personal civic rights. In New Jersey, joining a pro-life senate campaign's ground game can sway tight races. For example, volunteers in Warren County helped elect a school choice advocate through weekend canvassing.

Volunteering builds community, with church groups forming "faith teams" for campaigns. This hands-on involvement disciple believers in cultural engagement.

Moreover, skills like graphic design or data entry amplify impact. Volunteering has flipped local seats, proving grassroots power.

‚úÖ **Donate to candidates** - Individuals can donate up to state limits personally, supporting candidates who champion biblical values. A $2,600 contribution to a pro-family assembly candidate funds mailers reaching thousands.

Donations from church networks have funded underdog victories, like a 2021 upset in Cumberland County.

Teaching cheerful giving for politics parallels tithes, stewarding resources for kingdom advancement.

‚úÖ **Host house parties** - Members can host candidate meet-and-greets at home, inviting neighbors for Q&A. A backyard barbecue in Somerset County introduced a conservative to 50 voters.

These intimate settings humanize candidates, building coalitions. House parties have launched successful local campaigns.

They also evangelize through hospitality, blending politics with gospel witness.

‚úÖ **Share on social media** - Posting voter guides, candidate videos, or issue explanations reaches digital networks exponentially. A viral thread on abortion stance swayed youth in Essex County.

Social media amplifies truth, countering progressive narratives. Church-sanctioned hashtags unite efforts.

Responsible sharing includes fact-checking, modeling Christian witness online.

‚úÖ **Pray daily** - Committing to daily prayer for elections invites divine sovereignty. Prayer apps or journals focus intercession on New Jersey's needs.

Daily prayer sustained a Burlington County church through a contentious race, seeing prayer answered in victory.

It aligns hearts with God's will, powering all other actions.

‚úÖ **Vote early** - Members should vote early to avoid obstacles, securing conservative votes. Early voting in Mercer County ensured high turnout despite storms.

Planning votes as appointments honors civic stewardship.

Early voting allows testifying to faith through action.

‚úÖ **Serve as poll watchers** - Training as poll watchers ensures integrity, reporting irregularities. In Atlantic County, Christian watchers prevented fraud attempts.

This service protects democracy, requiring certification through county boards.

Poll watching embodies watchman-on-the-wall duty.

**Success Stories from New Jersey Churches**

In 2021, Faith Assembly in Perth Amboy mobilized comprehensively, with the pastor endorsing the pro-life gubernatorial candidate from the pulpit, distributing 3,000 voter guides, and hosting a forum attended by 400. Members volunteered 1,000 hours, hosted 12 house parties, and ran registration drives adding 250 voters. Early voting caravans and poll watchers ensured integrity. Though the statewide race was close, local conservatives gained seats, attributing success to prayer emphases and biblical citizenship preaching. This holistic approach increased church attendance by 15% as members saw faith's public relevance.

Another triumph came from Calvary Chapel in Vineland, where a 40-day prayer vigil preceded the 2022 midterms. Pastors preached on citizenship, members shared on social media reaching 10,000, and donations funded ads for school choice candidates. Voter turnout soared 25% in precincts, flipping two school board seats to parents' rights advocates who ended CRT mandates. The church's non-partisan yet values-driven strategy inspired statewide replication.

Finally, Grace Community in Toms River hosted forums and registration drives that registered 500, with members serving as poll watchers uncovering minor discrepancies corrected on-site. Social media campaigns and house parties built momentum for a pro-Second Amendment assembly win by 300 votes. Prayer chains and early voting pushes solidified gains, proving small churches can impactÂ§ß„Åç„Åè.

## üìÖ CRITICAL DATES

**2025 Election Calendar:**

- **June 2, 2025** - Primary Election. The Primary Election on June 2, 2025, serves as the crucial gateway for New Jersey voters to select party nominees for statewide offices, including governor in off-years, as well as legislative and local positions. This date marks the culmination of petition filings and campaign pushes, where conservatives must turnout strongly to ensure pro-life, pro-family candidates advance to November. In New Jersey's semi-closed primary system, registered Republicans and unaffiliated voters can choose Republican ballots, making church mobilization essential to counter progressive dominance in urban areas. Past primaries have seen low turnout favor extremes, so encouraging early preparation‚Äîstudying voter guides months ahead‚Äîmaximizes impact. Churches should plan registration drives by April to capture new voters before the May deadline for party changes.

The June primary also decides ballot positions via county conventions, influencing visibility. Conservatives winning primaries in districts like LD8 or LD21 set up winnable generals. Historical data shows 2021 primary turnout at 20%, leaving room for faithful voters to dominate. Mark calendars now, pray for candidates, and commit to voting as unto the Lord.

- **October 14, 2025** - Voter registration deadline. October 14, 2025, is the firm deadline for New Jerseyans to register for the general election, 21 days before November 4. Missing this cuts off participation, so churches must run final drives in September. Online registration via vote.nj.gov simplifies the process, requiring ID and address proof. In 2023, late registrations surged conservative numbers in suburban counties, narrowing margins.

This deadline pressures mobilization; plan church events around it, like "Registration Sunday" on October 5. Unaffiliated voters switching to Republican by this date strengthen primaries too, though 2025 focuses on general. Educate on same-day registration absence in NJ‚Äîact early.

- **October 25-November 2, 2025** - Early voting period. New Jersey's early voting period from October 25 to November 2, 2025, offers nine days of in-person machine voting at designated sites, open 10 AM-8 PM weekdays and 10 AM-6 PM weekends. This accommodates schedules, reducing Election Day lines. In 2022, over 1 million used early voting, with conservatives encouraged to participate to bank votes against potential weather or suppression.

Churches can organize shuttles, especially for elderly in rural areas like Sussex. Promote via pulpits starting September, listing county sites. Early voting ensures voices heard amid life‚Äôs uncertainties.

- **November 4, 2025** - General Election Day. General Election Day on November 4, 2025, decides New Jersey's direction, with all 120 legislative seats potentially in play alongside local races. Polls open 6 AM-8 PM; voters must go to assigned precincts. This culmination demands full mobilization‚Äîprayer, transportation, poll watching.

Historical turnouts around 60% leave evangelicals, 20% of population, pivotal if 80% vote conservative. 2021's close gubernatorial race underscores every vote. Celebrate as holy day of stewardship.

**2026 Election Calendar:**

- **June 1, 2026** - Primary Election. Shifting to June 1, 2026, the primary nominates for federal midterms, including U.S. House and Senate if applicable, plus state locals. Preparation mirrors 2025, with focus on congressional districts where NJ conservatives can gain.

- **October 13, 2026** - Voter registration deadline. October 13, 2026, locks registration 21 days pre-general, urging fall drives.

- **October 24-November 1, 2026** - Early voting period. October 24 to November 1, 2026, provides early access, likely expanded post-2025.
