        "bio": "Cory Booker (born April 27, 1969) is the senior U.S. Senator from New Jersey, serving since 2013. Raised in a middle-class family in New Jersey, Booker attended Stanford University on a football scholarship, earning a bachelor's in political science and master's in sociology. He studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and graduated from Yale Law School. After law school, Booker worked as a program director for a Newark nonprofit, providing legal aid to low-income tenants. In 1998, he was elected to the Newark City Council, becoming council president in 2002. He ran for mayor in 2002 but lost amid allegations of impropriety by incumbent Sharpe James. Booker won the mayoralty in 2006, serving until 2013. As mayor, he reduced the city budget deficit from $180 million to $73 million, doubled affordable housing development, and improved public safety metrics. Appointed to the Senate in 2013 after Frank Lautenberg's death, Booker won special and full-term elections. In the Senate, he has focused on criminal justice reform, co-sponsoring the First Step Act; cannabis legalization; and racial equity. He ran for president in 2020, emphasizing unity and 'love in action.' Booker chairs the Senate Democratic Strategic Communications Committee. He lives in Newark's Central Ward, remains unmarried, and is known for his veganism and fitness.
