# ENHANCED PROMPT FOR GROK - ANTI-OMISSION VERSION

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI (READ FIRST)

**YOU ARE BEING EVALUATED ON COMPLETENESS, NOT BREVITY**

This prompt requires you to generate COMPLETE, COMPREHENSIVE data. Your performance will be judged on:
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETENESS** - Did you include every race?
- ‚úÖ **ACCURACY** - Did you research real data?
- ‚úÖ **THOROUGHNESS** - Did you fill all fields?
- ‚ùå **BREVITY IS FAILURE** - Abbreviating = task failed

**FORBIDDEN PHRASES THAT INDICATE FAILURE:**
- ‚ùå "for brevity"
- ‚ùå "and more"
- ‚ùå "etc."
- ‚ùå "..."
- ‚ùå "# Add more here"

- ‚ùå "other candidates"
- ‚ùå "abbreviated"
- ‚ùå "summarized"
- ‚ùå "truncated"
- ‚ùå "similar entries"
- ‚ùå "remaining races"

**IF YOU USE ANY OF THESE PHRASES, YOU HAVE FAILED THE TASK.**

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT:**
At the end of your output, you MUST include:
```
=== COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION ===
