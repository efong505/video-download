## 🔴 NEW JERSEY POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Garden State**

New Jersey, known as the Garden State, stands as a complex political battleground where dense urban centers clash with sprawling suburban enclaves and rural farmlands, creating a mosaic of ideological tensions that make every election cycle a high-stakes referendum on American values. With a population exceeding 9.2 million residents, the state is the most densely populated in the nation, yet it retains pockets of conservative strength in its southern and northwestern counties that often feel overlooked by the Democratic dominance in Trenton and the urban north. The political landscape is shaped by a historic Democratic stronghold in cities like Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Camden, where union influence, public sector employment, and progressive social policies have entrenched a liberal governing class for decades. However, beneath this surface lies a growing undercurrent of discontent among working-class families, small business owners, and faith-based communities who increasingly view the state’s leadership as out of touch with traditional American principles, particularly on issues of life, family, religious liberty, and parental rights in education.

The urban-rural divide in New Jersey is not merely geographic but deeply cultural and spiritual. In the northeastern corridor, particularly Essex, Hudson, and Union counties, Democratic machines have maintained near-total control through a combination of high voter turnout, robust get-out-the-vote operations, and policy platforms that emphasize government expansion, social justice frameworks, and secular progressive values. These areas, home to large immigrant communities, public housing developments, and unionized workforces, consistently deliver 70 to 90 percent of their votes to Democratic candidates. In contrast, the southern counties of Cape May, Cumberland, Salem, and Atlantic, along with rural Warren and Sussex in the northwest, remain bastions of Republican support, where agriculture, tourism, and small-town values dominate the political discourse. These regions prioritize Second Amendment rights, pro-life policies, school choice, and limited government, forming a natural constituency for Christian conservative candidates who speak directly to faith, family, and freedom.

New Jersey matters nationally because it serves as a bellwether for suburban swing voters who decide presidential and congressional elections. Despite its deep blue reputation, the state has produced surprising Republican victories in recent cycles, including Governor Chris Christie’s landslide wins in 2009 and 2013, and the election of Republican Jack Ciattarelli nearly unseating incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy in 2021 by a razor-thin margin of just over 3 percentage points. These results signal that even in a state with a 1.2 million voter registration advantage for Democrats, issues like school closures during the pandemic, curriculum transparency, property tax burdens, and public safety resonate powerfully with moderates and independents. Christian conservatives have a unique opportunity to capitalize on these frustrations by presenting a unified message that ties fiscal responsibility to moral clarity, offering voters an alternative to the progressive orthodoxy that has dominated state politics for a generation.

The conservative opportunity in New Jersey is rooted in demographic shifts and policy failures that have alienated key voting blocs. Skyrocketing property taxes, the highest in the nation at an average of $9,500 per household, have fueled a taxpayer revolt that transcends party lines. Parents across the state, from Toms River to Teaneck, have mobilized against explicit sexual education curricula, critical race theory frameworks, and transgender policies in schools that they believe undermine parental authority and traditional family structures. Faith communities, particularly Catholic, evangelical, and Orthodox Jewish voters, have grown increasingly vocal in defense of religious liberty after state mandates forced churches to close while big-box retailers remained open during the COVID-19 crisis. These grievances create fertile ground for Christian conservative candidates who can articulate a vision of governance that protects life from conception, defends the nuclear family, and restores local control over education and public safety.

The 2025 and 2026 election cycles represent a pivotal moment for New Jersey conservatives to rebuild and expand their influence from the ground up. With all 120 state legislative seats on the ballot in 2025, along with thousands of school board and municipal positions, the opportunity exists to flip local bodies that directly impact curriculum, zoning, taxation, and law enforcement. The 2026 federal races, including the U.S. Senate contest and all 12 congressional districts, offer a chance to challenge entrenched Democratic incumbents who have grown complacent after years of one-party dominance. Christian conservative activists have already begun organizing through church networks, homeschool coalitions, and pro-life organizations to identify, recruit, and train candidates who reflect biblical values in public policy. Success in these races could reshape the state’s political trajectory for a decade, proving that even in deep blue territory, truth spoken boldly can move mountains.

The path forward requires strategic focus on winnable districts and issues that unite rather than divide the conservative coalition. In South Jersey’s 2nd Congressional District, for example, Republican incumbents have held serve by emphasizing Second Amendment rights, opposition to offshore wind projects that threaten fishing industries, and support for law enforcement. In suburban districts like the 7th and 11th, where independent voters hold the balance of power, candidates who combine fiscal conservatism with compassionate pro-life messaging have flipped seats from blue to red. School board races in towns like Marlboro, Cherry Hill, and Westfield have seen parent-led slates sweep elections by campaigning on transparency, academic excellence, and the removal of ideological indoctrination from classrooms. These local victories demonstrate that Christian conservative principles, when presented with clarity and conviction, resonate far beyond traditional Republican strongholds.

Ultimately, New Jersey’s political future will be determined by which side better understands the anxieties and aspirations of its families. Democratic policies that prioritize government expansion, late-term abortion protections, and identity politics have created a permission structure for conservative alternatives that emphasize human dignity, personal responsibility, and community solutions. The state’s Catholic heritage, with over 3.2 million adherents, its growing evangelical population in urban ministries, and its Orthodox Jewish communities in Lakewood and Teaneck, represent a sleeping giant of values voters waiting to be awakened. Christian conservatives who invest in grassroots organizing, digital outreach, and candidate development now will position themselves to lead New Jersey into a new era of faith-guided governance that honors God, protects the vulnerable, and restores the Garden State to its foundational promise of liberty and justice for all.

## 🔴 2026 U.S. SENATE RACE

### **U.S. Senate** - November 3, 2026

**Context:** The New Jersey U.S. Senate seat held by Cory Booker since 2013 represents one of the most high-profile opportunities for Christian conservatives to challenge progressive orthodoxy in a deep blue state. With Booker facing a well-funded Republican challenger amid national debates over abortion, religious liberty, and parental rights, this race will test whether traditional values can gain traction in a state dominated by urban Democratic machines. A Republican upset would send shockwaves through Washington and signal a broader realignment in suburban America.

**Cory Booker (Democrat)** - Incumbent Senator

**Faith Statement:** "My faith teaches me that we are all connected, that service to others is the highest calling, and that love must guide our public policy."

**Background:**  
Cory Anthony Booker was born on April 27, 1969, in Washington, D.C., to parents Carolyn and Cary Booker, both successful IBM executives who moved the family to Harrington Park, New Jersey, to provide better educational opportunities for their children. He attended Northern Valley Regional High School in Old Tappan, where he excelled in football, earning a scholarship to Stanford University. At Stanford, Booker studied political science and earned a bachelor’s degree in 1991, followed by a master’s degree in sociology in 1992. He continued his education at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, obtaining a degree in modern history in 1994, and later graduated from Yale Law School in 1997 with a Juris Doctor. His early career included work with the Urban Justice Center in New York, advocating for low-income housing and tenant rights.  
Booker entered politics in 1998 when he was elected to the Newark Municipal Council, where he served until 2006, gaining attention for high-profile protests against drug dealing and open-air markets in public housing. In 2006, he was elected mayor of Newark, serving two terms until 2013 and implementing crime reduction strategies, economic development initiatives, and education reforms that drew national attention. His mayoral tenure included a controversial 100-day hunger strike in a drug-infested neighborhood and a personal rescue of a neighbor from a burning building, cementing his image as a hands-on leader. In October 2013, he won a special election to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy left by the death of Frank Lautenberg, and he was reelected to a full term in 2014 and again in 2020.  
Booker has never married and has no children, maintaining a private personal life while cultivating a public persona centered on optimism, bipartisanship, and social justice. He resides in Newark’s Central Ward and is known for his active social media presence, vegan lifestyle, and close friendships with Republican colleagues like Tim Scott and Rand Paul. His memoir, *United*, published in 2016, details his journey from suburban privilege to urban advocacy.

**Christian Conservative Analysis:**  
- **Pro-Life:** Cory Booker has maintained a consistently pro-choice voting record throughout his Senate tenure, earning a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood and a 0 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee. He co-sponsored the Women’s Health Protection Act in 2021 and 2022, which sought to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and eliminate state-level restrictions on abortion, including late-term procedures and parental notification requirements. Booker voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act in 2019 and 2020, which would have required medical care for infants born alive after failed abortion attempts. He has publicly stated that abortion is a fundamental human right and has criticized pro-life pregnancy centers as deceptive. His position aligns with the most progressive wing of the Democratic Party on this issue.  
- **Religious Liberty:** Booker has expressed support for religious freedom in principle but has prioritized anti-discrimination laws over faith-based exemptions in practice. He voted against the Respect for Marriage Act’s religious liberty amendments in 2022, opposing provisions that would have protected faith-based adoption agencies and businesses from government punishment for adhering to traditional marriage beliefs. During the 2020 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Booker questioned her Catholic faith and its influence on judicial decisions, particularly regarding abortion and LGBTQ issues. He has supported the Equality Act, which critics argue would force religious schools and charities to violate their doctrines on gender and sexuality.  
- **Education/Parental Rights:** Booker has been a strong advocate for public education and teachers’ unions, opposing school choice initiatives that would direct public funds to private or religious schools. He voted against the Education Savings Accounts for Military Families Act in 2019 and has criticized voucher programs as draining resources from public schools. During his mayoral tenure, he supported charter school expansion in Newark, but in the Senate, he has aligned with progressive calls to regulate and limit charter growth. He has remained silent on parental rights legislation and has not opposed curriculum mandates that include gender ideology and critical race theory in public schools.  
- **Family Values:** Booker supports the redefinition of marriage to include same-sex couples and has championed LGBTQ rights throughout his career. He performed same-sex marriages as mayor of Newark after the state legalized them in 2013 and has co-sponsored multiple bills to expand transgender protections, including in youth sports and healthcare. He opposes the traditional nuclear family model as the sole societal ideal, instead promoting diverse family structures. His personal choice to remain unmarried and childless has been cited by critics as disconnected from family-centered policy priorities.  
- **Overall Assessment:** 1/10. Cory Booker’s record reflects a progressive worldview that consistently prioritizes government expansion and secular social policies over biblical principles of life, liberty, and family. While he invokes faith rhetorically, his votes and public statements demonstrate hostility to pro-life protections, religious exemptions, and parental authority in education.

**Key Positions:**  
- **ABORTION:** Cory Booker believes abortion should be legal through all nine months of pregnancy for any reason, with taxpayer funding and no parental consent requirements for minors. He has vowed to make codification of Roe v. Wade a top priority and opposes any state-level restrictions.  
- **EDUCATION:** Booker supports increased federal funding for public schools, opposes school choice vouchers for religious institutions, and backs comprehensive sex education that includes gender identity and sexual orientation instruction beginning in elementary school.  
- **RELIGIOUS FREEDOM:** While claiming to support faith, Booker backs policies that would compel religious organizations to violate their doctrines on marriage, sexuality, and life issues in order to participate in government programs or public accommodations.  
- **GUNS:** Booker advocates for universal background checks, red flag laws, assault weapons bans, and magazine capacity limits, earning an F rating from the NRA.  
- **TAXES:** Booker supports raising taxes on high earners, corporations, and capital gains to fund expanded social programs, universal healthcare, and climate initiatives.

**Endorsements:** Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Human Rights Campaign, New Jersey Education Association, Emily’s List, League of Conservation Voters

- **Overall Assessment:** 9/10. Curtis Bashaw offers a strong Christian conservative alternative with a proven pro-life record, commitment to religious liberty, and family-centered policy vision.

### **U.S. House District 1** - November 3, 2026

**Context:** New Jersey’s 1st Congressional District encompasses Camden County and parts of Gloucester and Burlington counties, including the cities of Camden and Cherry Hill. Once a Democratic stronghold driven by urban machine politics and public sector unions, the district has trended more competitive as suburban voters in Cherry Hill and Voorhees prioritize school quality, public safety, and property taxes.
