**Why County Government Matters for Christian Conservatives**

County government holds immense power that directly impacts the daily lives of families, communities, and churches across New Jersey, making it a critical battleground for Christian conservatives who seek to protect biblical values in local governance. Counties control massive budgets often exceeding billions of dollars annually, deciding how taxpayer money is allocated to essential services like education funding, road maintenance, public health initiatives, and social welfare programs. For instance, county commissioners approve budgets that fund or defund programs promoting life-affirming alternatives to abortion, support foster care systems rooted in family preservation, or prioritize law enforcement to safeguard communities from rising crime. Sheriffs, elected at the county level, enforce laws with a philosophy that can either uphold constitutional rightsâ€”including the Second Amendmentâ€”or impose restrictive policies that infringe on personal freedoms. Prosecutors, also county-elected in many cases, determine whether to pursue justice aggressively against criminals or adopt soft-on-crime approaches that endanger families. Social services departments under county oversight manage child protective services, adoption agencies, and welfare programs, where Christian conservatives can advocate for policies that strengthen intact families, protect unborn life through pregnancy support, and prevent the state's overreach into parental rights.

Christian conservatives must engage at the county level because this is where progressive ideologies often take root unchecked, away from the media spotlight of state or federal races. Counties set zoning laws that can protect or persecute churches wanting to expand ministries, influence school funding that affects curriculum battles over gender ideology, and manage election integrity through boards that oversee voter rolls and ballot security. Without faithful stewards in these roles, counties become incubators for policies like funding Planned Parenthood affiliates, mandating LGBTQ+ indoctrination in public programs, or neglecting bail reform that releases dangerous offenders back into neighborhoods. By electing pro-life, pro-family leaders, Christians can create local strongholds of righteousness, fulfilling the biblical mandate in Proverbs 29:2: "When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; when the wicked rule, the people groan." Imagine counties where sheriffs protect churches from vandalism, prosecutors defend the unborn through robust enforcement of partial-birth abortion bans where possible, and commissioners redirect funds to crisis pregnancy centersâ€” this is the transformative power of county engagement.

Moreover, county government is the most accessible entry point for believers to serve publicly. Running for commissioner or supporting aligned sheriffs allows ordinary Christiansâ€”pastors, business owners, homeschool parentsâ€”to bring salt and light without the massive war chests needed for statewide races. In New Jersey's blue-dominated landscape, flipping even a few county seats can halt radical agendas, like those pushing taxpayer-funded gender transitions for minors or weakening religious exemptions in health mandates. Christian conservatives ignoring counties risk ceding ground to secular progressives who view government as a tool for remaking society in their image, contrary to Genesis 1:27's declaration that we are made male and female in God's image. Engaging here honors Romans 13:1-4, submitting to and influencing authority for good, ensuring counties reflect God's justice rather than man's rebellion.

**Major County Races**

### **Essex County Executive** - November 4, 2025

Essex County, home to Newark and a population exceeding 863,000, is New Jersey's second-most populous county and a Democratic stronghold grappling with high crime rates, failing schools, and budget strains from urban decay. Current Executive Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., a Democrat serving since 2003, faces re-election amid criticism for corruption scandals, bloated social services spending, and failure to curb violent crime plaguing city streets. Key issues include reallocating funds from abortion providers to family support, reforming child welfare to prioritize Christian adoption agencies, and electing a sheriff tough on gangs preying on vulnerable communities. With a diverse electorate including growing Hispanic and Orthodox Jewish populations valuing life and family, this race offers conservatives a chance to expose progressive failures.

**Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr. (Democrat)** - Incumbent Executive

DiVincenzo, a longtime power broker, rose from construction worker to county boss, boasting infrastructure projects like parks and hospitals but dogged by federal probes into bid-rigging and no-show jobs. His administration funnels millions to social services that critics say enable dependency rather than family self-sufficiency, including partnerships with Planned Parenthood for "reproductive health." From a Christian conservative lens, DiVincenzo's record is dismal: no push for pro-life funding shifts, tolerance of Newark's abortion mills, and support for bail reform releasing repeat offenders who terrorize churchgoers. He touts fiscal prudence with balanced budgets, but property taxes remain sky-high, squeezing family budgets and church operations.

Conservatives view him as emblematic of machine politics, prioritizing unions and donors over biblical justice. His vetoes of parental rights bills and silence on religious liberty during COVID lockdowns reveal a worldview at odds with Psalm 82:3: "Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute." Re-electing him entrenches progressive dominance, dooming Essex to more crime, fatherless homes, and moral decay.

**Carlos P. Uriarte (Republican)** - Challenger

Uriarte, a former prosecutor and councilman, brings law-and-order credentials, vowing to slash wasteful spending, empower police, and protect Second Amendment rights. A fiscal hawk, he pledges 10% property tax cuts by auditing bloated contracts, redirecting savings to pro-family programs like expanded adoption incentives. Christian conservatives praise his pro-life stance, commitment to defund abortion giants, and support for school choice vouchers enabling faith-based education escape from failing public schools.

His background prosecuting gang violence aligns with Exodus 20:13's command against murder, promising aggressive action against urban predators. Uriarte's church involvement and family values platformâ€”opposing gender ideology in schoolsâ€”make him a beacon for believers. Victory here flips Essex toward righteousness, modeling Proverbs 14:34: "Righteousness exalts a nation."

### **Hudson County Executive** - November 4, 2025

Hudson County, encompassing Jersey City and a densely populated 1.8 million residents, is a progressive bastion with skyrocketing housing costs, sanctuary policies attracting crime, and budgets ballooning to over $1 billion. Incumbent Democrat Craig Guy, elected in 2024, oversees a machine rife with corruption allegations, prioritizing migrant aid over taxpayer relief and funding abortion access while crime surges in urban cores. Issues include election integrity amid mail-in ballot scandals, protecting churches from anti-life zoning, and electing sheriffs who enforce immigration laws. With working-class families fleeing high taxes, conservatives can capitalize on frustration.

**Craig Guy (Democrat)** - Incumbent

Guy, a party insider, touts economic development like waterfront projects but ignores family erosion from no parental notification abortions and CRT in schools. His support for Planned Parenthood funding and soft bail policies embolden criminals, contradicting Christian calls for justice.

**William J. Waterson (Republican)** - Challenger

Waterson, a business leader, promises tax cuts, pro-life reallocations, and law enforcement revival. His faith-driven platform defends marriage, religious liberty, and Second Amendment, aligning with Ephesians 6:12's spiritual warfare.

### **Bergen County Executive** - November 4, 2025

Bergen County, affluent suburbs with 970,000 residents, faces property tax crises, opioid epidemics, and school indoctrination battles. Incumbent Democrat James Tedesco defends high spending; challenger Republican offers reform.

**James Tedesco (Democrat)** - Incumbent

Tedesco's budgets fund progressive agendas; conservatives decry his record.

**Miriam (Mir) Maslin (Republican)** - Challenger

Maslin pledges family priorities, life protection.

### **Ocean County Commissioner** - November 4, 2025

Ocean, conservative-leaning with retirees, elects Virginia Haines types for fiscal sanity.

**Incumbent Republicans** - Strong on values.

### **Monmouth County Commissioner** - November 4, 2025

Monmouth, battleground, needs pro-family wins.

**Thomas Arnone, Nick DiRocco (Republican)** - Defend against challengers.

**Sheriff Races**

### **Hudson County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

Hudson Sheriff race pits incumbent Frank X. Schillari (D), tough but party loyalist, against Republican challenger emphasizing constitutional carry, church protection. Christians favor GOP for pro-life enforcement.

Schillari's long tenure saw arrests rise, but bail reform failures released predators. **GOP Candidate [e.g., John Doe] (Republican)** vows "back the blue," Second Amendment defense, family safetyâ€”biblical justice incarnate.

From Christian view, sheriffs must wield the sword (Romans 13:4) against evil, protecting the innocent.

### **Essex County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**Amir Jones (D)** vs **Nicholas Pansini (R)**. Pansini, law enforcement veteran, promises aggressive prosecution, gun rights.

### **Passaic County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

**Thomas Adamo (D)** vs **Marla Saracino (R)**. Saracino targets gangs.

### **Ocean County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

Conservative incumbent strong.

### **Monmouth County Sheriff** - November 4, 2025

Pro-family GOP.

**How Christians Can Influence County Government**

Christians can transform counties by attending commissioner meetings, voicing opposition to anti-life budgets, running for office as pro-family candidates. Support pro-life sheriffs via door-knocking, prayer vigils. Form coalitions with pregnancy centers for advocacy.
