**Faith Statement:** "As a Christian, I believe in the sanctity of life from conception to natural death. My faith guides every vote I cast in Congress, and I will never compromise on protecting the unborn, defending religious liberty, or upholding the biblical definition of marriage between one man and one woman."

**Background:**
- Born in 1953 in New York, Van Drew grew up in South Jersey and earned his dental degree from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1979.
- Practiced dentistry for 30 years while serving in the New Jersey State Senate from 2008-2018 as a conservative Democrat.
- Elected to Congress in 2018 as a Democrat but switched to Republican in December 2019 after refusing to vote for Trump's impeachment.
