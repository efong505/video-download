## üî¥ 2026 Federal Races

### U.S. Senate Race - November 3, 2026

**Context:** New Jersey's U.S. Senate seat is up for election in 2026, with incumbent Democrat Cory Booker seeking his third full term. While New Jersey leans heavily Democratic, Christian conservatives have an opportunity to make their voices heard and potentially support a strong Republican challenger who aligns with biblical values on life, family, and religious liberty.

**Cory Booker (Democrat)** - Incumbent Senator

**Faith Statement:** Booker identifies as Baptist and has spoken about his faith journey, but his voting record consistently opposes traditional Christian values on key issues.

**Background:**
- Former Mayor of Newark (2006-2013)
- U.S. Senator since 2013 special election
- Rhodes Scholar, Yale Law School graduate
- Unmarried, vegan lifestyle advocate
- National profile as progressive leader

**Christian Conservative Analysis:**
- **Pro-Life:** Cory Booker has a 0% rating from National Right to Life. He voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require medical care for babies who survive abortion attempts. He co-sponsored the Women's Health Protection Act, which would eliminate virtually all state-level pro-life laws and allow abortion up until birth for any reason. Booker supports taxpayer funding of abortion and opposes parental notification laws.

- **Religious Liberty:** Booker opposed religious exemptions for the Little Sisters of the Poor and voted for the Equality Act, which would force Christian schools, churches, and businesses to violate their conscience on marriage and gender issues. He has questioned judicial nominees about their membership in the Knights of Columbus, suggesting anti-Catholic bias.

## SUMMARY STRUCTURE (WRITE IN FULL PROSE)

### Section 1: Executive Summary (MINIMUM 1,000 words)

Write a comprehensive introduction to New Jersey's 2025-2026 elections. This must be FULL PARAGRAPHS, not bullet points.

**Required content:**
- Why New Jersey matters for Christian conservatives (2-3 paragraphs)
- Overview of political landscape (2-3 paragraphs)
- Key dates and deadlines (1 paragraph)
- Priority races with detailed explanation of why each matters (3-4 paragraphs)
- Call to action for Christian voters (1-2 paragraphs)

**Example opening:**
```
New Jersey, the Garden State with 9.3 million residents, stands at a critical crossroads in the 2025-2026 election cycle. While the state has leaned Democratic in recent decades, Christian conservatives have significant opportunities to advance biblical values through strategic engagement in gubernatorial, legislative, school board, and federal races. The 2025 gubernatorial election, with Democrat Mikie Sherrill facing Republican Jack Ciattarelli, will determine the direction of state policy on abortion, education, religious liberty, and family values for the next four years.

The political landscape in New Jersey is complex and nuanced. Urban centers like Newark, Jersey City, and Paterson vote heavily Democratic, while suburban counties such as Morris, Ocean, and Monmouth lean Republican. The state's large Catholic population (over 3 million) and growing evangelical community (approximately 500,000) provide a strong foundation for faith-based political engagement. However, progressive policies on abortion, gender ideology in schools, and restrictions on religious liberty have created an urgent need for Christian conservative mobilization.

This urban and suburban district includes the city of Camden, one of the state's most economically challenged areas, as well as more affluent suburban communities. The district has a significant African American population and strong union presence, making it reliably Democratic territory.

Incumbent Donald Norcross, a Democrat who has represented the district since 2014, comes from a powerful South Jersey political family. His brother George Norcross is a Democratic power broker in the region. Donald Norcross previously served as a union electrician and business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 351 before entering politics. He served in the New Jersey General Assembly and State Senate before winning the special election to Congress.
