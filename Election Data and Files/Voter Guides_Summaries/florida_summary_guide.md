## ‚úùÔ∏è Christian Conservative Perspective

### Biblical Principles in Florida Governance

Florida has become a model for applying biblical principles to public policy:

**Sanctity of Life**: Florida has enacted strong pro-life protections, recognizing that life begins at conception (Psalm 139:13-16).

**Parental Rights**: Florida's Parental Rights in Education law protects children and honors the biblical mandate for parents to raise their children (Proverbs 22:6).

**Religious Freedom**: Florida protects the free exercise of religion, allowing churches and ministries to operate without government interference (1st Amendment, Acts 5:29).

**Traditional Marriage**: Florida recognizes the biblical definition of marriage between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6).

**Economic Freedom**: Florida's low-tax, pro-business policies reflect biblical stewardship principles (Proverbs 13:11, 2 Thessalonians 3:10).

### Key Issues for Christian Voters

1. **Life**: Protecting the unborn and supporting pregnancy resource centers
2. **Family**: Defending parental rights and traditional family values
3. **Education**: School choice and removing inappropriate content from schools
4. **Religious Liberty**: Protecting churches, Christian schools, and ministries
5. **Israel**: Supporting Israel and standing against antisemitism
