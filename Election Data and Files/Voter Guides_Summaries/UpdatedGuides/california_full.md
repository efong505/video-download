## üî¥ California POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Golden State**

California is a **deep blue stronghold with pockets of conservative resistance**:
- **Legislative Dominance:** Democrats hold supermajorities in both the State Assembly (62-18) and Senate (31-9), enabling unchecked progressive policies on abortion, gender ideology, and taxes.
- **Electoral Challenges:** The top-two primary system favors Democrats, but rural Central Valley and Inland Empire counties provide opportunities for conservative turnout.
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Liberal strongholds like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Sacramento contrast with conservative areas in Riverside, Kern, and Shasta Counties.
- **Economic Powerhouse Under Strain:** As the world's 5th largest economy, California grapples with homelessness, high costs, and exodus of families due to overregulation.

### **Why California Matters**

California is **CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:
- ‚úÖ **Pro-Life Leadership:** Despite Roe's fall, California enshrined unlimited abortion up to birth in 2022 (Prop 1); conservatives can push for parental consent and defunding Planned Parenthood.
- ‚úÖ **Second Amendment:** Strict gun laws rank CA last in freedom; GOP candidates vow to defend self-defense rights amid rising crime.
- ‚úÖ **School Choice:** Limited charter schools face union attacks; advocates seek vouchers to empower parental rights against CRT and gender curricula.
- ‚úÖ **Religious Liberty:** Threats from laws mandating LGBTQ+ resources in schools; protections needed for faith-based adoption agencies and churches.
- ‚úÖ **Family Values:** Gender ideology in schools erodes traditional marriage; conservatives fight for biological truth in sports and bathrooms.
- ‚úÖ **Election Integrity:** No voter ID, mail-in vulnerabilities; reforms essential to counter alleged fraud in a state with 22 million voters.
