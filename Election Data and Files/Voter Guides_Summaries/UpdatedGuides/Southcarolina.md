## 🔴 South Carolina POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Palmetto State**

**South Carolina** is a **deeply conservative stronghold in the Bible Belt**:  
- **Religious Composition:** Over 70% of residents identify as Christian, with evangelicals comprising a significant portion driving faith-based voting.  
- **Political Dominance:** Republicans control the governorship, both U.S. Senate seats, supermajorities in the state legislature, and all statewide offices, reflecting a consistent red wave since the 1990s.  
- **Cultural Heritage:** Rooted in Southern traditions, the state emphasizes family, faith, and limited government, with Charleston as a hub of historical Christian influence.  
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Coastal urban areas like Charleston and Columbia lean slightly more moderate due to tourism and universities, while rural Upstate and Lowcountry counties remain staunchly conservative, often prioritizing pro-life and gun rights.  
- **Bible Belt Beacon:** As a leader in religious liberty protections, South Carolina hosts annual faith conferences and has defended church autonomy in foster care and adoption.  

### **Why South Carolina Matters**

**South Carolina is CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:  
- ✅ **Pro-Life Leadership:** Enforces a strict six-week abortion ban with exceptions only for maternal life, and ongoing pushes for total bans like S.323 to eliminate fetal anomaly exceptions.  
- ✅ **Second Amendment:** Adopted constitutional carry in 2024, allowing permitless concealed carry for adults 18+, with strong self-defense laws and reciprocity agreements.  
- ✅ **School Choice:** Expanded Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) to $7,500 per student in 2025, serving 15,000 low-income families and removing public school attendance requirements for broader access.  
- ✅ **Religious Liberty:** Robust state laws protect faith-based agencies in adoption and foster care; Attorney General actively litigates for church hiring rights and against anti-religious ordinances.  
- ✅ **Family Values:** Defines marriage as one man-one woman; bans gender-transition procedures for minors under 18, with parental notification mandates for medical decisions.  
- ✅ **Election Integrity:** Strict voter ID required at polls; citizen-only voting affirmed by 2024 constitutional amendment, with robust absentee ballot verification.
