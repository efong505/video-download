## 🔴 Texas POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Lone Star State**

**Texas** is a **deep-red conservative stronghold**:
- **GOP Dominance:** Republicans control the governorship, both legislative chambers, and all statewide offices, with supermajorities in the Legislature ensuring conservative priorities like border security and tax cuts advance rapidly.
- **Energy Powerhouse:** As the nation's top oil and gas producer, Texas drives U.S. energy independence, fueling economic growth while resisting federal green mandates that threaten jobs and reliability.
- **Border Battleground:** With over 1,200 miles of Rio Grande frontier, Texas leads national fights against illegal immigration through Operation Lone Star, deploying state resources to protect sovereignty.
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Urban centers like Austin, Dallas, and Houston lean blue due to influxes of liberal transplants and tech elites, while rural areas and suburbs remain solidly red, creating flashpoints in school boards and city councils over issues like CRT and gender ideology.
- **Faith-Fueled Resilience:** Home to over 15 million evangelicals and Catholics, Texas boasts the highest church attendance in the South, empowering a robust Christian conservative voting bloc that has thwarted progressive overreach.

### **Why Texas Matters**

**Texas** is **CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:
- ✅ **Pro-Life Leadership:** Texas enforces one of the nation's strictest bans, prohibiting abortions after detection of a fetal heartbeat (around six weeks), with recent 2025 Life of the Mother Act clarifying exceptions to save maternal lives while upholding protections. Private lawsuits target abortion pill distributors, defunding Planned Parenthood entirely from state coffers.
- ✅ **Second Amendment:** Constitutional carry since 2021 allows permitless handgun carry for law-abiding adults 21+, with 2025 expansions easing access to suppressors and short-barreled rifles, ranking Texas among the freest gun states.
- ✅ **School Choice:** The 2025 Texas Education Freedom Accounts (TEFA) program launches vouchers up to $10,000 per student for private, homeschool, or faith-based options, a historic win after years of battles against teachers' unions.
- ✅ **Religious Liberty:** Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Chapter 110) shields faith-based actions from government burdens, protecting churches from COVID lockdowns and Christian businesses from anti-discrimination suits over biblical convictions.
- ✅ **Family Values:** State laws affirm traditional marriage, ban gender transitions for minors, and mandate parental consent for school discussions on sexuality, with 2025 amendments reinforcing biological sex in sports.
- **Border Fortress:** Operation Lone Star has arrested over 500,000 migrants since 2021, installing razor wire and marine barriers to combat fentanyl and cartel threats.
