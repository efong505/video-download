## 🔴 Georgia POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Peach State**

**Georgia** is a **battleground powerhouse with a Republican trifecta**:  
- **Economy:** Booming with low unemployment at 3.1% and attracting major investments like Rivian and SK Battery, but inflation hits rural families hardest.  
- **Demographics:** Diverse mix of urban Atlanta (heavily Democratic) and rural strongholds (solidly Republican), with growing Hispanic and Black populations influencing close races.  
- **Politics:** Republican control of governorship, legislature, and congressional delegation since 2005, but 2020-2024 flips show purple vulnerability.  
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Atlanta metro (60% of population) leans progressive on social issues, while South Georgia prioritizes faith, guns, and farms—creating tension in statewide contests.  
- **Faith Influence:** Bible Belt heartland with over 70% Christian population, driving conservative turnout in evangelicals and Baptists.  

### **Why Georgia Matters**

**Georgia is CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:  
- ✅ **Pro-Life Leadership:** Six-week heartbeat ban (LIFE Act) reinstated by state Supreme Court in October 2024, saving an estimated 10,000+ babies annually, though ongoing lawsuits challenge enforcement.  
- ✅ **Second Amendment:** Constitutional carry since 2022 allows permitless concealed carry for adults 21+, with strong preemption laws blocking local gun restrictions.  
- ✅ **School Choice:** Georgia Promise Scholarship provides up to $6,500 vouchers for 2024-2025, expanding to foster families in 2025, empowering 20,000+ students.  
- ✅ **Religious Liberty:** New Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) signed April 2025 protects faith-based decisions against government overreach.  
- ✅ **Family Values:** Bans on gender transitions for minors and parental consent laws upheld, affirming biblical marriage as one man-one woman.  
- ✅ **Election Integrity:** Strict voter ID and SB 202 reforms ensure secure elections, countering 2020 fraud claims.
