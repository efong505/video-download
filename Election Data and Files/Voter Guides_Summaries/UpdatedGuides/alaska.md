## 🔴 Alaska POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Last Frontier**

**Alaska** is a **deeply conservative stronghold with rugged individualism**:  
- **Political Lean:** Republican trifecta in state government, with strong GOP majorities in the legislature despite ranked-choice voting introducing independents and occasional Democratic upsets.  
- **Voter Base:** Over 60% of voters identify as conservative or Republican, bolstered by military presence, oil industry, and rural values.  
- **Electoral System:** Top-four primary and ranked-choice voting since 2022, which conservatives must navigate to consolidate support against split fields.  
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Anchorage and Fairbanks lean moderate-Democratic due to urban diversity, while rural areas like Mat-Su Valley and the North Slope are overwhelmingly conservative, driving statewide red outcomes.  
- **Resource-Driven Economy:** Oil, fishing, and mining fuel fiscal conservatism, with no state income or sales tax emphasizing low-government intervention.

### **Why Alaska Matters**

**Alaska** is **CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:  
- ✅ **Pro-Life Leadership:** Abortion legal up to viability with a 20-week limit, but no outright ban; state funds some via Medicaid, though conservatives push for restrictions amid ongoing legislative battles.  
- ✅ **Second Amendment:** Permitless constitutional carry since 2003, no assault weapon bans, and strong self-defense laws make it a national model for gun rights.  
- ✅ **School Choice:** Robust homeschool and correspondence programs via public funding, upheld by 2023 Supreme Court ruling; vouchers expanding despite union opposition.  
- ✅ **Religious Liberty:** State Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects faith-based actions; churches exempt from nondiscrimination mandates on marriage.  
- ✅ **Family Values:** Traditional marriage upheld, parental notification for minors' care required, and bans on gender transitions for minors advancing in legislature.  
- ✅ **Election Integrity:** No voter ID mandate but absentee reforms and poll watcher expansions; conservatives fight ranked-choice to prevent vote dilution.
