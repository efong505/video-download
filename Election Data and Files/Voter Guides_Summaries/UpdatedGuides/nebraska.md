## 🔴 Nebraska POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Cornhusker State**

**Nebraska** is a **solidly conservative stronghold**:  
- **Governing Majority:** Republicans hold supermajorities in the nonpartisan Unicameral Legislature (33-16 as of 2025), enabling consistent passage of pro-family and limited-government policies.  
- **Electoral History:** The state has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1964, with strong rural support driving conservative outcomes.  
- **Cultural Foundation:** Deep-rooted Midwestern values emphasize faith, agriculture, and self-reliance, with over 70% of Nebraskans identifying as Christian per recent Pew data.  
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Omaha and Lincoln lean moderately liberal (e.g., the 2025 Omaha mayoral upset), but rural areas dominate statewide, ensuring conservative control; the 2nd Congressional District remains a purple battleground.  
- **Agricultural Heartland:** As America's top corn and beef producer, Nebraska's economy ties policy to farm freedoms, including resistance to federal overreach on land and water rights.

### **Why Nebraska Matters**

**Nebraska** is **CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:  
- ✅ **Pro-Life Leadership:** A near-total abortion ban (LB 626, 2023) protects unborn life except in cases of rape, incest, or maternal health, though legal challenges persist; the state funds pregnancy centers via alternatives to abortion funds.  
- ✅ **Second Amendment:** Constitutional carry (LB 77, 2021) allows permitless concealed carry for adults 21+, with strong reciprocity and no red-flag laws.  
- ✅ **School Choice:** Opportunity Scholarships (LB 1085, 2024) provide ESAs up to $10,000 for private/homeschool options; homeschooling is robust with minimal regulations.  
- ✅ **Religious Liberty:** Strong protections under the Nebraska Religious Freedom Act (2017), shielding faith-based adoption agencies and businesses from discrimination suits.  
- ✅ **Family Values:** Traditional marriage upheld via constitutional amendment (2000); parental consent required for minors' gender transitions (LB 241, 2023), with bans on gender-affirming care for youth.  
- ✅ **Election Integrity:** Voter ID enforced since 2024, with strict absentee rules and regular voter roll purges.
