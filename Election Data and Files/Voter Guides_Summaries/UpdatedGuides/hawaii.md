## 🔴 Hawaii POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Aloha State**

**Hawaii** is a **deeply Democratic stronghold with minimal conservative influence**:  
- **Political Dominance:** Democrats control the governorship, both legislative chambers, and all statewide offices, holding supermajorities in the state House (45-6) and Senate (23-2) as of 2025, making it one of the most reliably blue states in the union.  
- **Voter Demographics:** Over 70% of registered voters identify as Democrats or non-partisan, with Republicans comprising less than 20%, reflecting a progressive culture shaped by union strength, environmentalism, and Native Hawaiian advocacy.  
- **Legislative Priorities:** The state legislature consistently advances left-leaning policies on climate, social welfare, and LGBTQ+ rights, often sidelining conservative concerns like fiscal restraint or traditional values.  
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Urban Honolulu drives progressive policies with its diverse, tourism-dependent population, while rural islands like Kauai and the Big Island show slightly more conservative leanings among farmers and veterans, but lack the votes to shift the balance.  
- **Island Isolation:** As the most remote U.S. state, Hawaii's high cost of living and dependence on federal aid amplify progressive calls for government intervention, challenging conservatives to frame solutions around self-reliance and aloha spirit rooted in Judeo-Christian ethics.

### **Why Hawaii Matters**

Hawaii is **CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:  
- ✅ **Pro-Life Leadership:** Abortion is legal up to viability with no parental consent required, and state funding supports Planned Parenthood; conservatives must push for protections amid ongoing expansion efforts.  
- ✅ **Second Amendment:** Hawaii has some of the nation's strictest gun laws, including no constitutional carry and recent Supreme Court challenges to "sensitive places" bans, making 2A defense a frontline battle.  
- ✅ **School Choice:** Limited charter schools and homeschool freedoms exist, but public education is dominated by teachers' unions pushing DEI and gender ideology; expansion of ESAs could empower parental rights.  
- ✅ **Religious Liberty:** While the state has a Religious Freedom Restoration Act, progressive nondiscrimination laws threaten faith-based businesses and adoption agencies, requiring vigilant defense.  
- ✅ **Family Values:** Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2013, with strong LGBTQ+ protections; conservatives advocate for parental notification on gender transitions and biological sex-based sports policies.  
- **Economic Pressures:** Sky-high housing costs and taxes burden families, offering conservatives an opportunity to champion fiscal responsibility and business freedom.

## 🔴 2026 GUBERNATORIAL RACE

### **Governor of Hawaii** - November 3, 2026

**Context:** The 2026 gubernatorial race will determine Hawaii's executive leadership during a time of escalating housing crises, climate threats, and cultural shifts, directly impacting policies on life, family, and religious freedoms in a state where Democratic dominance has stifled conservative voices for decades. With incumbent Josh Green eligible for re-election, this contest represents a rare chance for conservatives to challenge the status quo and inject biblical values into state governance. As the only major statewide race in 2025-2026, it sets the tone for legislative priorities and judicial appointments.

**Republican/Conservative Candidates:**

**Duke Aiona (R)** - Former Lieutenant Governor

**Faith Statement:** "My Catholic faith guides every decision I make in public service, rooted in the belief that all life is sacred from conception to natural death, and that government must protect the vulnerable as Christ commands."

**Background:**  
- Born and raised in Hawaii, Aiona is a former state judge and prosecutor with over 20 years in public service, including two terms as Lieutenant Governor (2003-2010) under Republican Gov. Linda Lingle.  
- He founded the Pacific Gateway Center to aid immigrant families and has coached youth sports, emphasizing community and family.  
- Married to Vivian with five children, Aiona is an active member of St. Anthony Catholic Church in Honolulu, where he teaches catechism.  
- Ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010 and 2014, garnering strong conservative support each time.

**Christian Conservative Analysis:**  
- **Pro-Life:** Aiona has a 100% pro-life voting record from his legislative days and pledged to defund Planned Parenthood and enact parental consent laws if elected.  
- **Religious Liberty:** Championed faith-based initiatives as Lt. Gov., supporting exemptions for Christian businesses under nondiscrimination laws.  
- **Education/Parental Rights:** Advocated for school choice expansions, including vouchers, and opposes CRT in curricula, prioritizing parental input.  
- **Family Values:** Strong defender of traditional marriage and opposes state-funded gender transitions for minors.  
- **Overall Assessment:** 9/10 – Aiona's consistent alignment with biblical principles and proven conservative record make him a beacon for Hawaii's faithful, though his past electoral losses highlight the uphill battle in a blue state.

**Key Positions:**  
- **ABORTION:** Supports a 20-week ban, parental notification, and ultrasound requirements; vows to redirect funds from abortion providers to pregnancy centers.  
- **EDUCATION:** Backs ESA programs for homeschoolers and charters; fights union control to ensure faith-based opt-outs from gender ideology.  
- **RELIGIOUS FREEDOM:** Would strengthen the state's RFRA to protect churches and Christian counselors from compelled speech.  
- **GUNS:** Pushes for constitutional carry and reciprocity, challenging Hawaii's restrictive permitting as unconstitutional post-Bruen.  
- **TAXES:** Advocates cutting property taxes for families and reducing business regulations to combat the state's 40%+ poverty rate.  
- **Housing Crisis:** Proposes faith-community partnerships for affordable housing without expanding government overreach.

**Endorsements:** National Right to Life, Family Research Council, Hawaii Family Forum, Catholic Diocese of Honolulu, Hawaii Rifle Association.

**Democratic/Progressive Candidates:**

**Josh Green (D)** - Incumbent Governor

**Faith Statement:** "No publicly disclosed faith statement"

**Background:**  
- A physician-turned-politician, Green served as Lt. Gov. before winning the governorship in 2022 with 63% of the vote.  
- Focused on healthcare and homelessness, he expanded Medicaid but faced criticism for high spending amid Hawaii's budget deficits.  
- Married with two daughters; raised Jewish but identifies as non-religious in public.  
- Oversaw COVID response, including vaccine mandates that drew religious exemption lawsuits.

**Christian Conservative Analysis:**  
- **Pro-Life:** Signed bills expanding abortion access and vetoed minor restrictions; funds Planned Parenthood heavily.  
- **Religious Liberty:** Supported mandates overriding faith-based objections during COVID; weak on protecting Christian adoptions.  
- **Education/Parental Rights:** Backs union-backed public schools with DEI integration; no push for choice programs.  
- **Family Values:** Advanced LGBTQ+ protections, including gender-affirming care for youth without parental opt-out.  
- **Overall Assessment:** 2/10 – Green's progressive agenda clashes with core Christian values, prioritizing secular equity over biblical truth.

**Key Positions:**  
- **ABORTION:** Defends viability limit and opposes any restrictions, viewing it as reproductive justice.  
- **EDUCATION:** Invests in public schools with emphasis on equity and inclusion, resisting vouchers.  
- **RELIGIOUS FREEDOM:** Enforces nondiscrimination laws without broad exemptions for faith groups.  
- **GUNS:** Maintains strict controls, including red-flag laws and sensitive places bans under SCOTUS review.  
- **TAXES:** Raised fees for climate initiatives; supports progressive taxation.  
- **Housing Crisis:** Pushes state-led developments, increasing regulations.

**Endorsements:** Planned Parenthood, Hawaii Teachers Union, Sierra Club, Democratic Party of Hawaii.

**Website:** governor.hawaii.gov

**Why It Matters:** This race will decide whether Hawaii continues its march toward unrestricted abortion and secular education or pivots toward life-affirming, faith-respecting governance that honors God's design for family and freedom.
