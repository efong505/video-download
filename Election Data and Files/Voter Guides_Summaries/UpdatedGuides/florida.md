## 🔴 Florida POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Sunshine State**

**Florida** is a **solid Republican stronghold**:  
- **Economy:** Ranked #1 in the U.S. for economic freedom with no state income tax, low corporate taxes at 5.5%, and business-friendly policies driving population growth and job creation.  
- **Demographics:** Rapidly growing with over 22 million residents, attracting conservative migrants from blue states, boosting GOP registration to 38% vs. Democrats' 35%.  
- **Politics:** Shifted from swing state to deep red since 2016, with Republicans controlling the governorship, both U.S. Senate seats, supermajorities in the legislature, and key local offices.  
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Urban areas like Miami-Dade and Broward lean Democratic due to diverse immigrant populations, while rural North Florida and suburbs like The Villages are overwhelmingly conservative strongholds.  
- **Tourism and Environment:** World's top tourism destination with 140 million visitors annually, but faces challenges from hurricanes and sea-level rise, where conservative policies emphasize resilience and limited government intervention.

### **Why Florida Matters**

**Florida** is **CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:  
- ✅ **Pro-Life Leadership:** Enacted a 6-week abortion ban in 2024, upheld by the state Supreme Court; bans partial-birth abortions and requires parental consent for minors, with strong defunding of Planned Parenthood.  
- ✅ **Second Amendment:** Permitless concealed carry since 2023; open carry legalized September 2025; no red-flag laws or magazine bans, ranking among top pro-gun states.  
- ✅ **School Choice:** Universal Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) since 2023, serving over 300,000 students; expanded vouchers and charters, banning CRT and gender ideology in public schools.  
- ✅ **Religious Liberty:** Ranked #1 nationally in 2025 for protections, including church autonomy, faith-based adoption rights, and medical conscience clauses.  
- ✅ **Family Values:** Defines marriage as one man-one woman; bans gender transitions for minors; enforces shared parental responsibility and notification laws.
