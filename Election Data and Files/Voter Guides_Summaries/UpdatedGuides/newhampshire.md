## 🔴 New Hampshire POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Granite State**

**New Hampshire** is a **libertarian-leaning swing state with deep roots in individual freedoms**:  
- **Individual Liberty:** Known for its "Live Free or Die" motto, the state prioritizes minimal government intervention, no income or sales tax, and strong personal autonomy, making it a beacon for conservatives seeking limited government.  
- **Fiscal Conservatism:** With one of the lowest tax burdens in the nation, NH attracts businesses and families valuing economic freedom, though recent debates over property taxes highlight tensions in funding education and infrastructure.  
- **Swing Dynamics:** As a purple state, it flips between parties—Republicans hold the governorship and legislature post-2024, but Democrats dominate urban areas like Nashua and Portsmouth.  
- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Urban centers like Manchester (pop. 115k) lean Democratic with progressive pushes on social issues, while rural north and western counties are solidly Republican strongholds focused on guns, farming, and traditional values.  
- **First-in-Nation Primary:** NH's early presidential primary amplifies its national influence, drawing candidates and spotlighting conservative voices on faith, family, and freedom.

### **Why New Hampshire Matters**

**New Hampshire is WINNABLE** for Christian conservatives:  
- ✅ **Pro-Life Leadership:** Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks with exceptions for life/health, but 2025 saw failed 15-week ban (HB 476 withdrawn); conservatives pushed for tighter restrictions via NH Right to Life.  
- ✅ **Second Amendment:** Constitutional carry since 2017, no permit needed; NH leads 25-state coalition defending 2A rights against out-of-state restrictions, with strong self-defense laws.  
- ✅ **School Choice:** Universal Education Freedom Accounts (EFAs) expanded in 2025 to all students (SB 295), funding private/homeschool options up to $4,640 per child—18th state with universal choice.  
- ✅ **Religious Liberty:** Robust Religious Freedom Restoration Act (HB 620 introduced 2025); DOJ backed church land-use cases; protections for faith-based adoption and business owners.  
- ✅ **Family Values:** New Parental Bill of Rights (HB 10, 2025) affirms parents' role in education/upbringing; marriage age raised to 18 (SB 359, 2024); opposition to gender transitions in minors.  
- **Border Security:** No sanctuary policies; conservatives advocate E-Verify for jobs, countering influx from southern border affecting rural resources.
