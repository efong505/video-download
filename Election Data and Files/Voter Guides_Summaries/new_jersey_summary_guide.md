## üîµ NEW JERSEY POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Deep Blue Challenge**

New Jersey is a **HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC STATE** but with Republican opportunities:
- **Democrat Dominance:** Biden won by 16 points (2020), Murphy won governor by 3 points (2021)
- **Legislature:** Democrats control both chambers (Senate 25-15, Assembly 52-28)
- **Suburban Shift:** South Jersey and Ocean County remain Republican strongholds
- **Trump Factor:** Trump lost NJ badly, but Murphy's narrow 2021 win shows vulnerability
- **Tax Revolt:** Highest property taxes in nation ($9,000+ average) fueling anger

### **Why New Jersey Matters**

Despite Democrat dominance, Republicans can compete:
- ‚úÖ **Tax Anger:** Property taxes, income taxes crushing middle class
- ‚úÖ **Crime Concerns:** Bail reform releasing violent criminals
- ‚úÖ **Education Battles:** Parents' rights, school choice gaining traction
- ‚úÖ **South Jersey Base:** Atlantic, Cape May, Ocean, Cumberland counties reliably red
- ‚úÖ **Catholic Vote:** Large Catholic population (34% of state) - pro-life potential
- ‚úÖ **Murphy Fatigue:** Governor Phil Murphy's COVID policies, tax increases unpopular

## üí° CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE VOTER STRATEGY

### **Priority 1: Governor - Jack Ciattarelli (R)**

**Why He's Critical:**
- Only Republican who came close to winning (2021)
- Pro-life, pro-family, school choice supporter
- Can win suburbs while holding South Jersey base
- Opposes Murphy's tax-and-spend policies

**How to Support:**
- Volunteer early (he needs grassroots army)
- Donate (Democrats will outspend 3-to-1)
- Register new voters (especially in South Jersey)
- Pray for campaign and family

### **Priority 2: State Legislature - Break Supermajorities**

**Why It Matters:**
- Democrats have veto-proof supermajorities
- Can override Republican governor on abortion, taxes, education
- Breaking supermajority gives governor negotiating power
- Opportunity to block worst progressive legislation

**Target Races:**
- Focus on LD-1, LD-2, LD-8, LD-11 (Senate flips)
- Defend LD-24, LD-26 (must hold)
- Volunteer in competitive districts

### **Priority 3: Local Races - School Boards, County Offices**

**Why They Matter:**
- School boards control curriculum, budgets
- County freeholders control property taxes
- Sheriffs enforce (or don't enforce) laws
- Local races have low turnout - Christians can win
