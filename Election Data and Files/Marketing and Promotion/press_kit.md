   - Voters don't know who's running in their state
   - Candidate websites lack faith-based information
   - No centralized resource for Christian voters

3. **Lack of Biblical Guidance**

## STORY ANGLES

**Key Points:**

## SAMPLE INTERVIEW Q&A

**Q: Why did you create this tool?**
A: We saw a huge gap in resources for Christian voters. Most voter guides focus on federal races and ignore state elections—but that's where the real power is. State legislatures control abortion laws, parental rights, education policy, and religious freedom. We wanted to give Christians the information they need to vote biblically in every race, not just the presidential election.

**Q: How is this different from other voter guides?**
A: Three things make us unique. First, we cover ALL races—from Governor down to state legislature. Second, we include candidate faith statements and biblical issue analysis. Third, it's completely free and interactive—just click your state and see everything. Most voter guides are PDFs or require registration. Ours is instant and mobile-friendly.

**Q: Isn't this partisan?**
A: We're not endorsing specific candidates. We're providing information so Christians can make informed decisions based on biblical principles. We show where candidates stand on life, family, and freedom—then voters decide. Churches can use this without violating 501(c)(3) rules because it's educational, not endorsement.

**Q: Why focus on state elections?**
A: Because that's where the battles are won or lost. The President can't ban abortion—state legislatures can. The President can't mandate what's taught in schools—state legislatures can. The President can't protect religious freedom in your community—state legislatures can. If Christians want to see change, we need to engage at the state level.

**Q: What's at stake in 2025-2026?**
A: Everything. 36 Governor races will determine who leads states for the next four years. 6,000+ state legislature seats will determine abortion laws, parental rights, education policy, and religious freedom. In 2026, all 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats are up. This is a massive opportunity for Christians to reshape the political landscape.

**Q: How can churches use this tool?**
A: Churches can share the link in bulletins, newsletters, and announcements. They can host voter registration drives and provide printed voter guides. They can encourage small groups to pray for elections. The key is that churches are providing information, not endorsing candidates—which is perfectly legal and appropriate.

**Q: What do you hope to accomplish?**
A: Our goal is simple: help Christians vote informed and engaged in every election. If we can increase Christian turnout in state elections by even 10%, we'll see pro-life, pro-family, pro-freedom candidates win across the country. When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice.
