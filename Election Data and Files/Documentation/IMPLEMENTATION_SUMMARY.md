# Implementation Summary

## 1. Faith Statement Fix ✅

### Problem
Existing candidates had "Not publicly disclosed" while new candidates show "No publicly disclosed faith statement" in the UI, creating inconsistency.

### Solution
Created `fix_faith_statements.py` script that:
- Scans all candidates in DynamoDB
- Finds candidates with "Not publicly disclosed"
- Updates to "No publicly disclosed faith statement"
- Maintains consistency across all 235 candidates

### Results
- **83 candidates updated** across all 9 states
- All faith statements now standardized
- UI displays consistent message for empty faith statements

### Files Created
- `Election Data and Files/Scripts/fix_faith_statements.py`

## 2. Editor/Contributor Role System ✅

### Problem
Contributors had no privileges - just listed in database. Need system where state correspondents can create/edit data for their state with admin approval.

### Solution
Implemented comprehensive 3-tier role system:

#### **Roles:**
1. **Admin/Super User** - Full access, no approval needed
2. **Editor** - Can create/edit for assigned state(s), requires approval
3. **Regular User** - Read-only access

#### **Workflow:**
1. Editor creates/edits candidate or race for their state
2. Change stored in `pending-changes` table
3. All admins notified via email
4. Admin reviews in `admin-pending-changes.html`
5. Admin approves or denies
6. If approved, change applied to live data

#### **Security:**
- Editors restricted to their assigned state(s)
- Cannot delete data
- Cannot approve own changes
- Full audit trail (who submitted, who approved, when)

### Features Implemented

#### **Database:**
- Created `pending-changes` table with fields:
  - change_id, change_type, data, submitted_by, submitted_at
  - status (pending/approved/denied), state
  - reviewed_by, reviewed_at

#### **API Endpoints:**
- `POST /contributors?resource=pending-changes` - Submit change
- `GET /contributors?resource=pending-changes` - List pending (admins only)
- `PUT /contributors?resource=pending-changes` - Approve/deny (admins only)

#### **Lambda Functions:**
- `verify_editor_token()` - Check editor permissions
- `is_editor_for_state()` - Verify state assignment
- `submit_change()` - Store pending change
- `list_pending_changes()` - Get all pending
- `review_change()` - Approve/deny change
- `apply_change()` - Execute approved change
- `notify_admins_of_pending_change()` - Email admins

#### **UI:**
- `admin-pending-changes.html` - Review interface for admins
  - Shows all pending changes
  - Displays change type, state, submitter
  - Shows full data being changed
  - One-click approve/deny buttons

### Change Types Supported
- `create_candidate` - New candidate
- `update_candidate` - Edit candidate
- `create_race` - New race
- `update_race` - Edit race

### Files Created
- `Election Data and Files/Scripts/create_pending_changes_table.py`
- `Election Data and Files/Documentation/EDITOR_ROLE_SYSTEM.md`
- `admin-pending-changes.html`
- Updated `contributors_api/index.py` with editor system

### Deployment
- ✅ Created `pending-changes` DynamoDB table
- ✅ Updated Lambda function `contributors-api`
- ✅ Deployed to production

## How to Use

### For Admins: Setting Up an Editor

1. **Add as Contributor:**
   - Go to `admin-contributors.html`
   - Add user with email, state, first/last name, phone
   - Set status to "active"

2. **Assign Editor Role:**
   ```python
   import boto3
   db = boto3.resource('dynamodb', region_name='us-east-1')
   users_table = db.Table('users')
   
   users_table.update_item(
       Key={'email': 'editor@example.com'},
       UpdateExpression='SET #role = :role',
       ExpressionAttributeNames={'#role': 'role'},
       ExpressionAttributeValues={':role': 'editor'}
   )
   ```

3. **Editor can now:**
   - Login to admin dashboard
   - Create/edit candidates and races for their state
   - Submit changes for approval

### For Admins: Reviewing Changes

1. **Receive email** when editor submits change
2. **Open** `admin-pending-changes.html`
3. **Review** change details
4. **Click** Approve or Deny
5. **Done** - Change applied if approved

### For Editors: Submitting Changes

1. **Login** to admin dashboard
2. **Navigate** to Candidates or Races
3. **Create/Edit** data (only for your state)
4. **Submit** - Goes to pending queue
5. **Wait** for admin approval
6. **Notified** when approved/denied

---

## Benefits

1. **Scalability** - 50 state correspondents can contribute simultaneously
2. **Quality Control** - All changes reviewed before going live
3. **Accountability** - Full audit trail of all changes
4. **Security** - Editors can't break data outside their state
5. **Efficiency** - Admins review instead of doing data entry

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Email notification to editor when change approved/denied
- [ ] Bulk approve/deny multiple changes
- [ ] Comments/feedback on changes
- [ ] Editor dashboard showing pending status
- [ ] Auto-approve trusted editors after X successful changes
- [ ] Change history/audit log viewer
- [ ] Revert approved changes
- [ ] Editor performance metrics
- [ ] In-app notification system
- [ ] Weekly digest of pending changes

## Testing

### Test Editor Workflow:
1. Create test user with editor role
2. Add as contributor for test state (e.g., "Test State")
3. Login as editor
4. Try to create candidate for assigned state → Should submit for approval
5. Try to create candidate for different state → Should be denied
6. Login as admin
7. View pending changes
8. Approve change
9. Verify candidate created in database

### Test Security:
- Editor cannot delete data ✅
- Editor cannot approve own changes ✅
- Editor restricted to assigned state ✅
- Admin receives email notification ✅
- Full audit trail recorded ✅
