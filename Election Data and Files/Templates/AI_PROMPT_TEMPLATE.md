## Troubleshooting

**If AI output doesn't match format:**
1. Point to specific template: "Follow the structure in `state_summary_template.md`"
2. Reference formatting rules: "Use the formatting in `FORMATTING_RULES.md`"
3. Show example: "Match the Texas/New Mexico format exactly"
4. Be explicit: "Use `**bold**` markdown, include üî¥ emoji, add `---` dividers"

**If output is too short:**
- "Expand to 15,000-25,000 characters for comprehensive 20-30 page guide"
- "Add more detail to each section following Hawaii/California examples"

**If Christian conservative perspective is missing:**
- "Emphasize Christian conservative analysis throughout"
- "Include faith statements and biblical values alignment for all candidates"
- "Address all 8 key focus areas: pro-life, school choice, religious liberty, family values, 2nd Amendment, election integrity, border security, economic freedom"
