**Database:** DynamoDB tables (races, candidates, state-summaries)  
**Admin Interface:** CSV bulk import for races and candidates  
**Public Interface:** Election map displays state summaries with markdown/HTML support  
**Perspective:** Christian conservative voter guides emphasizing pro-life, religious liberty, parental rights, and biblical values

## Files in This Directory

### 1. FORMATTING_RULES.md

**Key Rules:**
- Markdown structure with `#`, `##`, `###` headers
- Bold formatting with `**text**`
- Required emojis for each section
- Horizontal dividers `---` between sections
- Specific order of sections

### 2. state_summary_template.md

2. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with actual state data
3. Follow the exact section order
4. Maintain all formatting (bold, emojis, dividers)

### 3. upload_state_template.py
**Purpose:** Python script template for uploading state data to DynamoDB

**Important Notes:**
- Use `[SUCCESS]` instead of emoji in print statements (Windows compatibility)
- Match candidate `race_id` to race `race_id` for proper linking
- Summary content must follow `state_summary_template.md` structure

## Workflow for Adding a New State

### Step 1: Research
Gather information about:
- All races (federal, statewide, municipal) for 2025-2026 election cycle
- Major candidates with bios, positions, endorsements, **faith statements**
- State political landscape and demographics
- Christian conservative priorities: pro-life, school choice, religious liberty, family values, 2nd Amendment, election integrity
- Election dates and deadlines
- Local Christian conservative organizations and resources
- State-specific issues affecting Christian voters

### Step 2: Write Summary Content
1. Open `state_summary_template.md`
2. Copy the entire template
3. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with state-specific content
4. Follow `FORMATTING_RULES.md` exactly
5. Verify all required sections are present
6. Check character count (aim for 15,000-25,000 for comprehensive 20-30 page guide)
7. Ensure Christian conservative perspective throughout
8. Include detailed candidate analysis with faith statements
9. Address all 8 key focus areas (pro-life, school choice, religious liberty, family values, 2nd Amendment, election integrity, border security, economic freedom)

### Step 3: Create Upload Script
1. Copy `upload_state_template.py`
2. Rename to `upload_[state_name]_data.py`
3. Fill in races array with all state races
4. Fill in candidates array with all candidates
5. Paste your summary content from Step 2 into the content field
6. Verify all race_id matching is correct

### Step 4: Upload to Database
1. Navigate to Scripts directory
2. Run: `python upload_[state_name]_data.py`
3. Verify success messages
4. Check website to confirm data appears correctly
