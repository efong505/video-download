# State Election Data Templates

This directory contains templates and formatting rules for creating consistent state election summaries for the Christian conservative election platform.

## Project Context

**Platform:** State election coverage system with interactive US map  
**Database:** DynamoDB tables (races, candidates, state-summaries)  
**Admin Interface:** CSV bulk import for races and candidates  
**Public Interface:** Election map displays state summaries with markdown/HTML support  
**Perspective:** Christian conservative voter guides emphasizing pro-life, religious liberty, parental rights, and biblical values

## Files in This Directory

### 1. FORMATTING_RULES.md
**Purpose:** Complete formatting standards for all state summaries
**Use:** Reference this document before creating any state summary to ensure consistency

**Key Rules:**
- Markdown structure with `#`, `##`, `###` headers
- Bold formatting with `**text**`
- Required emojis for each section
- Horizontal dividers `---` between sections
- Specific order of sections

### 2. state_summary_template.md
**Purpose:** Blank template showing exact structure
**Use:** Copy this structure when writing state summary content

**How to Use:**
1. Copy the template
2. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with actual state data
3. Follow the exact section order
4. Maintain all formatting (bold, emojis, dividers)

### 3. upload_state_template.py
**Purpose:** Python script template for uploading state data to DynamoDB
**Use:** Copy and customize for each state

**How to Use:**
1. Copy file and rename: `upload_[state_name]_data.py`
2. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with actual data
3. Fill in races, candidates, and summary content
4. Run: `python upload_[state_name]_data.py`

**Important Notes:**
- Use `[SUCCESS]` instead of emoji in print statements (Windows compatibility)
- Match candidate `race_id` to race `race_id` for proper linking
- Summary content must follow `state_summary_template.md` structure

## Workflow for Adding a New State

### Step 1: Research
Gather information about:
- All races (federal, statewide, municipal) for 2025-2026 election cycle
- Major candidates with bios, positions, endorsements, **faith statements**
- State political landscape and demographics
- Christian conservative priorities: pro-life, school choice, religious liberty, family values, 2nd Amendment, election integrity
- Election dates and deadlines
- Local Christian conservative organizations and resources
- State-specific issues affecting Christian voters

### Step 2: Write Summary Content
1. Open `state_summary_template.md`
2. Copy the entire template
3. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with state-specific content
4. Follow `FORMATTING_RULES.md` exactly
5. Verify all required sections are present
6. Check character count (aim for 15,000-25,000 for comprehensive 20-30 page guide)
7. Ensure Christian conservative perspective throughout
8. Include detailed candidate analysis with faith statements
9. Address all 8 key focus areas (pro-life, school choice, religious liberty, family values, 2nd Amendment, election integrity, border security, economic freedom)

### Step 3: Create Upload Script
1. Copy `upload_state_template.py`
2. Rename to `upload_[state_name]_data.py`
3. Fill in races array with all state races
4. Fill in candidates array with all candidates
5. Paste your summary content from Step 2 into the content field
6. Verify all race_id matching is correct

### Step 4: Upload to Database
1. Navigate to Scripts directory
2. Run: `python upload_[state_name]_data.py`
3. Verify success messages
4. Check website to confirm data appears correctly

### Step 5: Quality Check
- [ ] All races appear on state page
- [ ] All candidates linked to correct races
- [ ] Summary displays with proper formatting
- [ ] Emojis render correctly
- [ ] Bold text appears bold
- [ ] Section dividers visible
- [ ] Download buttons work (TXT and PDF)

## Questions?

If formatting is unclear, always refer to:
1. `FORMATTING_RULES.md` - The authoritative standard
2. Existing state summaries - Real examples
3. `state_summary_template.md` - Blank structure

## CSV Import Option

The admin interface supports CSV bulk import for races and candidates:

**Races CSV Format:**
```
state,office,election_date,race_type,description
Texas,Governor,2026-11-03,general,Texas Gubernatorial Race
```

**Candidates CSV Format:**
```
name,state,office,party,bio,website,faith_statement,positions,endorsements
Ted Cruz,Texas,U.S. Senate,Republican,Conservative senator...,https://tedcruz.org,Strong Christian faith,abortion:pro-life;guns:strong-support,NRA;Texas Right to Life
```

**Note:** Python upload scripts provide more control and are recommended for comprehensive state data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Data Accuracy Verification

### The Number Matching Problem

**IMPORTANT:** When using AI to generate upload scripts, the AI may write incorrect numbers in the summary text!

**Example of the Problem:**
```python
races = [{...}, {...}, {...}]  # 40 actual races
candidates = [{...}, {...}]  # 30 actual candidates

summary = {
    "content": """
    Total Races Documented: 120  ‚Üê AI WROTE WRONG NUMBER!
    Total Candidates Profiled: 300  ‚Üê AI WROTE WRONG NUMBER!
    """
}
```

### Why This Matters

The upload script:
- ‚úÖ Uploads 40 races to the `races` table (correct)
- ‚úÖ Uploads 30 candidates to the `candidates` table (correct)
- ‚ùå Uploads text saying "120 races" to the `state-summaries` table (WRONG!)

The website displays whatever text is in the summary, so users see "120 races" even though only 40 exist!

### MANDATORY Verification Before Upload

**Before running ANY upload script:**

1. **Count the races array:**
   ```python
   races = [{...}, {...}, {...}]  # Count: 40 items
   ```

2. **Count the candidates array:**
   ```python
   candidates = [{...}, {...}]  # Count: 30 items
   ```

3. **Verify the summary text matches:**
   ```python
   summary = {
       "content": """
       Total Races Documented: 40  ‚Üê MUST match races count!
       Total Candidates Profiled: 30  ‚Üê MUST match candidates count!
       """
   }
   ```

4. **If numbers don't match, edit the summary text before running!**

### Tools Available

**If you forget to verify and upload wrong numbers:**

```bash
# Check for discrepancies across all states
python audit_all_states_data.py

# Automatically fix all summaries to match database
python fix_all_state_summaries.py
```

**For detailed instructions, see:**
- `HOW_TO_USE_PROMPT.md` - Complete verification guide
- `ELECTION_DATA_ACCURACY_SUMMARY.md` - Full explanation of the system

### Updated AI Prompt

The `full_prompt.md` template has been updated with:
- Explicit instructions to count arrays: `len(races)` and `len(candidates)`
- Verification checklist before submitting
- Examples of correct vs incorrect counting

**Always use the updated prompt template!**
