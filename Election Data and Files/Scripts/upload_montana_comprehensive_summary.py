## 🔴 MONTANA POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Treasure State**

Montana is **DEEP RED STATE WITH VULNERABLE DEMOCRAT SENATOR**:

- **Trump Country:** Trump won by 16.4% (2020), 20.4% (2016) - solid Republican state
- **Electoral Power:** 4 electoral votes - reliably Republican
- **Geographic Reality:** Rural, conservative, independent-minded voters
- **Democrat Anomaly:** Jon Tester only statewide Democrat - extremely vulnerable
- **Religious Strength:** Strong Christian presence - Catholic, evangelical, Lutheran
- **Senate Opportunity:** Tester most vulnerable Democrat in nation - TOP PICKUP

### **Why Montana Matters**

Montana is **CRITICAL FOR SENATE CONTROL**:

- ✅ **#1 Senate Pickup:** Jon Tester most vulnerable Democrat - Trump +16 state
- ✅ **Senate Control:** This seat alone could flip Senate to Republican majority
- ✅ **Deep Red State:** Trump won by 16 points - Tester out of step with Montana
- ✅ **Pro-Life Culture:** Strong Montana Right to Life, conservative values
- ✅ **2nd Amendment:** Constitutional carry, strong gun rights tradition
- ✅ **Energy Jobs:** Coal, oil, gas workers oppose Biden green agenda
- ✅ **Rural Values:** Agriculture, ranching, hunting, fishing - traditional Montana

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** Montana represents the ultimate Senate pickup opportunity. Jon Tester is last Democrat standing in deep red state. With Trump winning by 16 points and Tester voting with Biden 95%+, 2026 is opportunity to flip this seat, secure Senate majority, and advance biblical values in national policy. Victory means Senate control, conservative judges, and stopping radical progressive agenda.
