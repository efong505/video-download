## 🔴 PENNSYLVANIA POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Keystone State**

Pennsylvania is **THE ULTIMATE BATTLEGROUND STATE**:

- **Swing State:** Biden won by 1.2% (2020), Trump won by 0.7% (2016) - razor-thin margins
- **Electoral Power:** 19 electoral votes - critical for presidential elections and national direction
- **Geographic Divide:** Philadelphia/Pittsburgh blue urban centers, "Pennsyltucky" red heartland
- **Working Class:** Steel, coal, manufacturing workers - culturally conservative, economically populist
- **Religious Heritage:** Strong Catholic, Lutheran, evangelical presence - 6+ million Christians
- **Suburban Battleground:** Philadelphia suburbs (Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery counties) decide statewide races

### **Why Pennsylvania Matters**

Pennsylvania is **WINNABLE** for Christian conservatives:

- ✅ **Working Class Appeal:** Blue-collar workers shifting Republican on economy, values, and cultural issues
- ✅ **Energy Workers:** 26,000+ fracking jobs, coal workers oppose Democrat green policies threatening livelihoods
- ✅ **Rural Strength:** Central PA deeply conservative, high church attendance, strong turnout potential
- ✅ **Pro-Life Base:** Strong Catholic and evangelical pro-life movement, pregnancy resource centers statewide
- ✅ **School Choice:** Growing parental rights movement in suburbs, charter school expansion
- ✅ **Crime Concerns:** Philadelphia crime crisis (500+ murders annually) drives suburban voters right

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** Pennsylvania represents a pivotal battleground where biblical values can shape national policy. With strong Catholic and evangelical communities, robust pro-life infrastructure, and growing parental rights movement, Christian conservatives have the infrastructure and motivation to flip this state. Victory here means Senate control, stopping radical progressive agenda, and advancing Kingdom priorities on life, family, and religious freedom.

## 🎯 KEY ISSUES FOR CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES

### **Life & Family**

**Biblical Foundation:** *"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart"* - Jeremiah 1:5

**Conservative Position:**
- Protect unborn life at every stage from conception to natural death
- Support Pennsylvania's 200+ pregnancy resource centers providing alternatives to abortion
- Defend parental rights in education - parents, not government, raise children
- Protect traditional marriage as God designed between one man and one woman
- Oppose gender ideology in schools - protect children from transgender indoctrination
- Support adoption and foster care - 15,000+ PA children need loving homes

**Progressive Position:**
- Abortion on demand through all nine months, even partial-birth abortion
- Force pregnancy centers to close or promote abortion
- Hide gender transitions from parents, allow schools to socially transition children
- Redefine marriage and family, promote LGBTQ+ agenda to children
- Promote LGBTQ+ curriculum in schools starting in kindergarten
- Prioritize LGBTQ+ adoption over traditional families

**What's at Stake:** Pennsylvania has 30,000+ abortions annually. Pro-life laws could save thousands of lives. Parental rights protect children from radical gender ideology. Traditional family values preserve God's design for marriage and family.

**Christian Conservative Action:**
- Support 100% pro-life candidates with no exceptions compromise
- Volunteer at pregnancy resource centers - donate time, money, supplies
- Attend school board meetings - speak up for parental rights and against CRT/gender ideology
- Defend parental rights - know what schools teach your children
- Vote for family values - support candidates who defend biblical marriage and family
- Consider fostering or adopting - provide loving homes for children in need

### **Religious Freedom**

**Biblical Foundation:** *"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's"* - Mark 12:17

**Conservative Position:**
- Protect church autonomy - government cannot dictate church doctrine or practice
- Defend Christian business owners - no forced participation in same-sex weddings or abortion
- Support religious schools and homeschools - parents choose education aligned with faith
- Protect conscience rights for healthcare workers - no forced participation in abortion or euthanasia
- Defend public Christian expression - prayer in schools, Ten Commandments displays, religious speech

**Progressive Position:**
- Force churches to comply with LGBTQ+ mandates or lose tax-exempt status
- Punish Christian business owners who decline same-sex weddings (bakers, florists, photographers)
- Restrict religious school freedom, force LGBTQ+ curriculum, threaten accreditation
- Force healthcare workers to participate in abortions against conscience
- Remove Christianity from public square - ban prayer, religious symbols, Christian speech

**What's at Stake:** Religious freedom is the first freedom. Without it, Christians cannot live out faith publicly, raise children in biblical values, or operate businesses according to conscience. Pennsylvania has strong religious liberty protections, but progressive policies threaten them.

**Christian Conservative Action:**
- Support First Amendment champions who defend religious liberty
- Defend religious liberty in courts - support Alliance Defending Freedom, First Liberty
- Protect Christian schools and homeschools - oppose government overreach
- Stand with persecuted believers - support Christian business owners facing lawsuits

- Tough on crime, support prosecutors who enforce law
- Oppose "defund the police" movement destroying cities

- Ignore Philadelphia violence, blame guns not criminals
- Open borders allow fentanyl flooding PA streets
- Prioritize criminal rights over victim rights

**What's at Stake:** Philadelphia has 500+ murders annually. Progressive prosecutors release violent criminals. Fentanyl kills 5,000+ Pennsylvanians yearly. Families aren't safe in their own neighborhoods. Law and order is biblical mandate.

**Christian Conservative Action:**
- Support pro-police candidates who back law enforcement
- Vote for tough-on-crime prosecutors, not progressive DAs
- Oppose progressive DAs like Larry Krasner who release criminals
- Back law enforcement - thank police, support police families
- Demand border security to stop fentanyl poisoning communities

### **Economy & Energy**

**Biblical Foundation:** *"The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof"* - Psalm 24:1. *"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord"* - Colossians 3:23

**Conservative Position:**

- Protect energy jobs - coal, natural gas workers feed families

- Vote for pro-business candidates who support free enterprise
- Defend Pennsylvania jobs - fracking, coal, manufacturing

### **Education & Parental Rights**

**Biblical Foundation:** *"Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it"* - Proverbs 22:6

**Conservative Position:**
- School choice and education freedom - parents choose best education for children
- Parental rights in education - parents, not government, decide what children learn
- Oppose CRT and gender ideology - stop indoctrination of children
- Focus on academics, not activism - reading, writing, math, not social justice
- Support charter schools and vouchers - give poor families choices rich families have
- Protect homeschool freedom - don't restrict parental choice

**Progressive Position:**

- Clean voter rolls - remove dead voters, moved voters, duplicate registrations
- Secure drop boxes - prevent ballot harvesting and fraud
- Transparent counting - observers watch every ballot counted
- Same-day results - count votes on election night, not days later

**Progressive Position:**

- Resist voter roll cleanup - keep dead voters, moved voters on rolls
- Unsecured ballot collection - drop boxes without monitoring
- Delayed counting - count for days, weeks after election
- Mail-in ballot expansion - universal mail voting without safeguards
- Oppose audits and transparency

**What's at Stake:** Pennsylvania's 2020 election had serious irregularities. Mail-in ballots, unsecured drop boxes, delayed counting raised concerns. Election integrity ensures every legal vote counts and illegal votes don't. Trust in elections is foundation of republic.

**Christian Conservative Action:**
- Support election integrity candidates who will reform PA election laws

- Oppose sanctuary policies - cooperate with federal immigration enforcement

- Limit cooperation with ICE - sanctuary policies protect illegal immigrants
- Oppose border wall and enforcement
- Provide services to illegal immigrants - taxpayer-funded benefits
- Amnesty for illegal immigrants - reward lawbreaking
- Prioritize illegal immigrants over American citizens

**What's at Stake:** Fentanyl from open border kills 5,000+ Pennsylvanians annually. Illegal immigration costs taxpayers billions. Border security protects American families, workers, communities. Pennsylvania feels impact of border crisis through drugs, crime, costs.

**Christian Conservative Action:**

- Oppose sanctuary policies in PA cities
- Demand fentanyl interdiction - stop drugs killing Pennsylvanians
