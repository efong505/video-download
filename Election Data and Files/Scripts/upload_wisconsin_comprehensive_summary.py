## 🔴 WISCONSIN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Badger State**

Wisconsin is **THE ULTIMATE SWING STATE** for Christian conservatives:

- **Razor-Thin Margins:** Biden won by 0.6% (2020), Trump won by 0.8% (2016) - every vote matters
- **Electoral Power:** 10 electoral votes - critical for presidential elections
- **Geographic Divide:** Milwaukee/Madison urban blue, rural Wisconsin deeply red
- **Industrial Heritage:** Manufacturing, dairy farming - working-class voters shifting Republican
- **Religious Strength:** 3+ million Christians - Catholic, Lutheran, evangelical presence
- **Senate Opportunity:** Tammy Baldwin vulnerable - CRITICAL PICKUP for Senate control

### **Why Wisconsin Matters**

Wisconsin is **WINNABLE AND CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:

- ✅ **Senate Control:** Defeating Tammy Baldwin could flip Senate to Republican majority - MUST WIN
- ✅ **True Swing State:** Margins under 1% - Christian turnout determines winners
- ✅ **Pro-Life Movement:** Strong Wisconsin Right to Life, 70+ pregnancy resource centers
- ✅ **School Choice Pioneer:** Nation's first school choice program, expanding parental rights
- ✅ **Election Integrity:** 2020 concerns, voter ID laws, clean elections critical
- ✅ **Working-Class Shift:** Manufacturing workers embracing conservative values

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** Wisconsin represents the ultimate battleground where Christian mobilization determines outcomes. With razor-thin margins, vulnerable Democrat senator, and competitive Governor race, 2026 is generational opportunity to flip Wisconsin red, advance biblical values, and prove that Midwest states reject progressive extremism. Victory means Senate control, pro-life protections, school choice expansion, and religious freedom defense.
