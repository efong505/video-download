## ðŸ”´ OHIO POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Buckeye State**

Ohio is **THE CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND** for Christian conservatives:

- **Trending Republican:** Trump won by 8 points (2020), 8 points (2016) - solid red shift
- **Electoral Power:** 17 electoral votes - bellwether state for national politics
- **Industrial Heartland:** Manufacturing, steel, auto workers - culturally conservative values
- **Geographic Divide:** Urban Cleveland/Columbus/Cincinnati blue, rural/suburban Ohio deeply red
- **Religious Heritage:** Strong Catholic, evangelical, Lutheran presence - 7+ million Christians
- **Senate Control:** Sherrod Brown's seat is TOP PICKUP OPPORTUNITY for Republican majority

### **Why Ohio Matters**

Ohio is **WINNABLE AND CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:

- âœ… **Senate Control:** Defeating Sherrod Brown could flip Senate to Republican majority
- âœ… **Open Governor Seat:** Mike DeWine term-limited - opportunity for strong conservative
- âœ… **Pro-Life Stronghold:** Strong right-to-life movement, pregnancy resource centers statewide
- âœ… **School Choice Leader:** Expanding voucher programs, parental rights movement growing
- âœ… **Manufacturing Base:** Working-class voters shifting Republican on economy and values
- âœ… **Election Integrity:** Strong voter ID laws, clean elections, transparent counting

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** Ohio represents the industrial heartland where biblical values meet working-class economics. With Trump's 8-point victories, Republican state government, and vulnerable Democrat senator, Ohio is positioned to deliver Senate control and advance Kingdom priorities. Victory here means stopping radical progressive agenda, protecting life, defending religious freedom, and showing that Rust Belt states embrace conservative values.
