## 🔴 ARIZONA POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Grand Canyon State**

Arizona is **CRITICAL BORDER STATE BATTLEGROUND** for Christian conservatives:

- **Border Crisis Central:** 370-mile border with Mexico - ground zero for illegal immigration
- **Swing State Status:** Biden won by 0.3% (2020), Trump won by 3.5% (2016) - razor-thin margins
- **Electoral Power:** 11 electoral votes - critical for presidential elections
- **Geographic Divide:** Phoenix/Tucson urban blue, rural Arizona deeply red
- **Growing Population:** Fastest-growing state - California refugees bringing conservative values
- **Religious Strength:** 3+ million Christians - Catholic, evangelical, Mormon presence
- **Senate Opportunity:** Competitive race - critical for Senate control

### **Why Arizona Matters**

Arizona is **WINNABLE AND CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:

- ✅ **Border Security:** #1 issue - Arizona on frontlines of immigration crisis
- ✅ **Swing State:** Narrow margins - Christian turnout determines winners
- ✅ **School Choice Leader:** Universal ESA program - model for nation
- ✅ **Election Integrity:** Major focus after 2020/2022 - voter confidence critical
- ✅ **Pro-Life Movement:** Strong Arizona Right to Life, 50+ pregnancy centers
- ✅ **Growing Christian Base:** California refugees bringing conservative values

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** Arizona represents the border security battleground where biblical values meet national security. With razor-thin margins, competitive Senate race, and border crisis as top issue, 2026 is opportunity to flip Arizona red, secure the border, advance biblical values, and prove that border states reject open-borders progressivism. Victory means Senate control, border security, school choice expansion, and election integrity.
