## 🔴 OHIO POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Buckeye State**

Ohio is **THE CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND** for Christian conservatives:

- **Trending Republican:** Trump won by 8 points (2020), 8 points (2016) - solid red shift from purple to red
- **Electoral Power:** 17 electoral votes - bellwether state that has predicted presidents for decades
- **Industrial Heartland:** Manufacturing, steel, auto workers - culturally conservative, economically populist
- **Geographic Divide:** Urban Cleveland/Columbus/Cincinnati blue islands, rural/suburban Ohio deeply red
- **Religious Heritage:** Strong Catholic, evangelical, Lutheran presence - 7+ million Christians statewide
- **Senate Control:** Sherrod Brown's seat is TOP PICKUP OPPORTUNITY for Republican Senate majority

### **Why Ohio Matters**

Ohio is **WINNABLE AND CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:

- ✅ **Senate Control:** Defeating Sherrod Brown could flip Senate to Republican majority - MUST WIN
- ✅ **Open Governor Seat:** Mike DeWine term-limited - opportunity for strong conservative leader
- ✅ **Pro-Life Stronghold:** Strong Ohio Right to Life, 200+ pregnancy resource centers statewide
- ✅ **School Choice Leader:** Expanding voucher programs, EdChoice scholarships, parental rights growing
- ✅ **Manufacturing Base:** Working-class voters shifting Republican on economy, trade, and values
- ✅ **Election Integrity:** Strong voter ID laws, clean elections, transparent counting, paper ballots

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** Ohio represents the industrial heartland where biblical values meet working-class economics. With Trump's consecutive 8-point victories, Republican supermajority in state legislature, and vulnerable Democrat senator, Ohio is positioned to deliver Senate control and advance Kingdom priorities. Victory here means stopping radical progressive agenda, protecting life, defending religious freedom, and proving that Rust Belt states embrace conservative values and reject coastal elitism.

## 🎯 KEY ISSUES FOR CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES

### **Life & Family**

**Biblical Foundation:** *"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart"* - Jeremiah 1:5

**Conservative Position:**
- Protect unborn life at every stage from conception to natural death
- Support Ohio's 200+ pregnancy resource centers providing alternatives to abortion
- Defend Ohio's Heartbeat Bill protecting babies with detectable heartbeat
- Defend parental rights in education - parents, not government, raise children
- Protect traditional marriage as God designed between one man and one woman
- Oppose gender ideology in schools - protect children from transgender indoctrination
- Support adoption and foster care - 16,000+ Ohio children need loving homes

**Progressive Position:**
- Abortion on demand through all nine months, even partial-birth abortion
- Force pregnancy centers to close or promote abortion
- Overturn Ohio's Heartbeat Bill through ballot initiatives
- Hide gender transitions from parents, allow schools to socially transition children
- Redefine marriage and family, promote LGBTQ+ agenda to children
- Promote LGBTQ+ curriculum in schools starting in kindergarten
- Prioritize LGBTQ+ adoption over traditional families

**What's at Stake:** Ohio has strong pro-life protections including Heartbeat Bill. Progressive ballot initiatives threaten these protections. Parental rights protect children from radical gender ideology in schools. Traditional family values preserve God's design for marriage and family.

**Christian Conservative Action:**
