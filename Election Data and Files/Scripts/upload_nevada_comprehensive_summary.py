## 🔴 NEVADA POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Silver State**

Nevada is **CRITICAL SWING STATE** for Christian conservatives:

- **Swing State Status:** Biden won by 2.4% (2020), Clinton won by 2.4% (2016) - narrow margins
- **Electoral Power:** 6 electoral votes - critical for presidential elections
- **Geographic Divide:** Las Vegas/Reno urban blue, rural Nevada deeply red
- **Gaming Economy:** Tourism, hospitality - working-class voters shifting Republican
- **Growing Christian Base:** Las Vegas area evangelical growth, Mormon presence
- **Senate Opportunity:** Jacky Rosen vulnerable - CRITICAL for Senate control

### **Why Nevada Matters**

Nevada is **WINNABLE AND CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:

- ✅ **Senate Control:** Defeating Jacky Rosen could flip Senate to Republican majority
- ✅ **Swing State:** Narrow margins - Christian turnout determines winners
- ✅ **School Choice Growing:** ESA program expanding, parental rights advancing
- ✅ **Election Integrity:** Mail-in voting concerns, ballot harvesting issues
- ✅ **Pro-Life Movement:** Growing Nevada Right to Life, pregnancy centers
- ✅ **Conservative Governor:** Joe Lombardo elected 2022 - opportunity to keep

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** Nevada represents the swing state where Christian mobilization determines outcomes. With vulnerable Democrat senator, conservative governor, and narrow margins, 2026 is opportunity to flip Nevada red, advance biblical values, and prove that swing states embrace conservative principles.
