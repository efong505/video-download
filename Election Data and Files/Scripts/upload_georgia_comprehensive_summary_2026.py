## 🔴 GEORGIA POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Peach State**

Georgia is **CRITICAL SWING STATE BATTLEGROUND** for Christian conservatives:

- **Purple State:** Biden won by 0.2% (2020), Trump won by 5.1% (2016) - razor-thin margins
- **Electoral Power:** 16 electoral votes - essential for presidential elections
- **Geographic Divide:** Atlanta metro blue, rural Georgia deeply red
- **Growing Population:** Fastest-growing state - northern transplants vs. conservative natives
- **Religious Strength:** 3+ million evangelical Christians, 1+ million Catholics
- **Senate Opportunity:** Jon Ossoff vulnerable in midterm - CRITICAL pickup
- **Open Governor Seat:** Brian Kemp term-limited - opportunity to maintain conservative leadership

### **Why Georgia Matters**

Georgia is **WINNABLE AND CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:

- ✅ **Senate Control:** Defeating Jon Ossoff could flip Senate to Republican majority - MUST WIN
- ✅ **Governor Race:** Kemp term-limited - maintain conservative leadership
- ✅ **Swing State:** Narrow margins mean Christian turnout determines winners
- ✅ **Pro-Life Movement:** Strong Georgia Right to Life, 100+ pregnancy centers
- ✅ **School Choice Growing:** Opportunity for expansion, parental rights advancing
- ✅ **Black Church:** Conservative values on life and family - opportunity for outreach
- ✅ **Military Presence:** Fort Moore (formerly Benning), Robins AFB - strong military values

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** Georgia represents the ultimate swing state where biblical values meet rapid growth. With vulnerable Democrat senator, open Governor seat, and razor-thin margins, 2026 is generational opportunity to flip Georgia red, advance Kingdom priorities, and prove that growing Southern states embrace conservative values. Victory means Senate control, pro-life protections, school choice expansion, and religious freedom defense.
