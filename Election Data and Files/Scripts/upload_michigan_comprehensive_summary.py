## 🔴 MICHIGAN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Great Lakes State**

Michigan is **CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND** for Christian conservatives:

- **True Swing State:** Biden won by 2.8% (2020), Trump won by 0.3% (2016) - razor-thin margins
- **Electoral Power:** 15 electoral votes - essential for presidential elections
- **Geographic Divide:** Detroit/Ann Arbor/Grand Rapids urban blue, rural Michigan deeply red
- **Industrial Heritage:** Auto manufacturing, skilled trades - working-class voters shifting Republican
- **Religious Strength:** 5+ million Christians - Catholic, Dutch Reformed, evangelical, Lutheran
- **Senate Opportunity:** Debbie Stabenow retiring - OPEN SEAT pickup opportunity

### **Why Michigan Matters**

Michigan is **WINNABLE AND CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:

- ✅ **Open Senate Seat:** Stabenow retiring - TOP PICKUP OPPORTUNITY for Republican Senate majority
- ✅ **Open Governor Seat:** Whitmer term-limited - chance to flip state leadership
- ✅ **Swing State:** Narrow margins mean Christian turnout determines winners
- ✅ **Pro-Life Movement:** Strong Right to Life of Michigan, 200+ pregnancy centers
- ✅ **School Choice Growing:** Education freedom expanding despite union resistance
- ✅ **Working-Class Shift:** Auto workers, trades shifting Republican on economy and values

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** Michigan represents the ultimate swing state where Christian mobilization determines outcomes. With open Senate and Governor seats, 2026 is generational opportunity to flip Michigan red, advance biblical values, and prove that Great Lakes states reject progressive extremism. Victory means Senate control, pro-life protections, school choice expansion, and religious freedom defense.

## 🎯 KEY ISSUES FOR CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES

### **Life & Family**

**Biblical Foundation:** *"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart"* - Jeremiah 1:5

**Conservative Position:**
- Protect unborn life at every stage from conception
- Support Michigan's 200+ pregnancy resource centers
- Defend parental rights - parents raise children, not government
