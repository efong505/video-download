## 🔴 NORTH CAROLINA POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

### **The Tar Heel State**

North Carolina is **CRITICAL SWING STATE BATTLEGROUND** for Christian conservatives:

- **True Swing State:** Trump won by 1.3% (2020), 3.7% (2016) - narrow margins, highly competitive
- **Electoral Power:** 16 electoral votes - essential for presidential elections
- **Geographic Divide:** Charlotte/Raleigh/Durham urban blue, rural North Carolina deeply red
- **Growing Population:** Fastest-growing state - northern transplants vs. conservative natives
- **Religious Strength:** 5+ million Christians - Baptist, evangelical, Catholic, Methodist presence
- **Senate Opportunity:** Competitive race - critical for Senate control
- **Open Governor Seat:** Roy Cooper term-limited - opportunity for conservative leadership

### **Why North Carolina Matters**

North Carolina is **WINNABLE AND CRITICAL** for Christian conservatives:

- ✅ **Senate Control:** Competitive Senate race could determine Republican majority - MUST WIN
- ✅ **Open Governor Seat:** Roy Cooper term-limited - chance to flip state leadership
- ✅ **Swing State:** Narrow margins mean Christian turnout determines winners
- ✅ **Pro-Life Movement:** Strong North Carolina Right to Life, 100+ pregnancy centers
- ✅ **School Choice Growing:** Opportunity Scholarships expanding, parental rights advancing
- ✅ **Research Triangle:** Tech growth bringing both liberal transplants and conservative entrepreneurs
- ✅ **Military Presence:** Fort Liberty (formerly Bragg), Camp Lejeune - strong military values

**Christian Conservative Opportunity:** North Carolina represents the ultimate swing state where biblical values meet rapid growth. With open Governor seat, competitive Senate race, and narrow margins, 2026 is generational opportunity to flip North Carolina red, advance Kingdom priorities, and prove that growing Southern states embrace conservative values. Victory means Senate control, pro-life protections, school choice expansion, and religious freedom defense.

## 🎯 KEY ISSUES FOR CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES

### **Life & Family**

**Biblical Foundation:** *"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart"* - Jeremiah 1:5
