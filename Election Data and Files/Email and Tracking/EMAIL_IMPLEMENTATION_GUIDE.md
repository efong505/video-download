# Email Subscription Implementation Guide

## Two Approaches Explained

### Approach 1: Mailchimp (Third-Party Service)
**How it works:**
- User enters email on your website
- JavaScript sends email to Mailchimp's servers
- Mailchimp stores the email in their database
- Mailchimp sends confirmation email automatically
- You manage subscribers through Mailchimp dashboard
- You send newsletters/updates through Mailchimp interface

**Pros:**
- No backend code needed
- Free for 500 subscribers
- Professional email templates
- Automated campaigns
- Analytics and reporting
- Handles unsubscribes automatically
- CAN-SPAM compliant

**Cons:**
- Third-party dependency
- Limited customization
- Data stored on Mailchimp servers
- Monthly email limits (1,000 on free plan)

### Approach 2: AWS SES + DynamoDB (Your Own System)
**How it works:**
- User enters email on your website
- JavaScript calls your Lambda function (API Gateway)
- Lambda stores email in DynamoDB
- Lambda sends confirmation email via AWS SES
- You manage subscribers in DynamoDB
- You send emails programmatically via SES

**Pros:**
- Full control over data
- No subscriber limits
- Cheaper at scale ($0.10 per 1,000 emails)
- Custom email logic
- Integration with existing AWS infrastructure

**Cons:**
- Requires backend development
- Must build email templates yourself
- Must handle unsubscribes manually
- Must ensure CAN-SPAM compliance
- More maintenance

## Cost Comparison

### Mailchimp Pricing:
- **Free**: 500 subscribers, 1,000 emails/month
- **Essentials**: $13/month - 500 subscribers, 5,000 emails/month
- **Standard**: $20/month - 500 subscribers, 6,000 emails/month

### AWS SES Pricing:
- **Emails**: $0.10 per 1,000 emails
- **DynamoDB**: $0.25 per million writes (essentially free for this use case)
- **Lambda**: Free tier covers 1 million requests/month
- **Example**: 10,000 emails/month = $1.00/month

## Recommendation

**Start with Mailchimp if:**
- You want quick setup (15 minutes)
- You have < 500 subscribers initially
- You want professional email templates
- You don't want to manage infrastructure

**Use AWS SES if:**
- You expect > 500 subscribers soon
- You want full control
- You're comfortable with AWS services
- You want to integrate with your existing database

## Implementation Details

### Mailchimp Setup (Simple)
1. Create Mailchimp account
2. Get embedded form URL
3. Update one JavaScript function
4. Done - emails automatically collected and confirmed

### AWS SES Setup (Advanced)
Requires:
1. DynamoDB table for subscribers
2. Lambda function for subscriptions
3. API Gateway endpoint
4. SES domain verification
5. Email templates
6. Unsubscribe handling
7. Bounce/complaint handling

## My Recommendation for You

**Start with Mailchimp** because:
- You're just launching
- Quick to implement
- Professional appearance
- Handles all email compliance
- You can migrate to AWS later if needed

**Switch to AWS SES when:**
- You exceed 500 subscribers
- You need custom email logic
- You want to save money at scale
- You want deeper integration with your election database
