```

The CSV includes: Email, Status, Subscribed Date, Source, Opens, Clicks, Last Activity

### Task 2: Check Who Opened Your Last Email
```bash
python analytics_queries.py
```

Look for the campaign_id of your last email and see the open count.

### Task 3: Remove Inactive Subscribers
```bash
# First, identify inactive subscribers (0 opens, old subscription date)
python manage_subscribers.py list active

# Then unsubscribe them individually
python manage_subscribers.py unsubscribe inactive@example.com
```

### Task 4: Send a Newsletter
```bash
# Edit send_newsletter.py with your content
python send_newsletter.py
```

### Task 5: View Subscriber Details
```bash
python manage_subscribers.py search user@example.com
```

### Task 6: Get Total Subscriber Count
```bash
python manage_subscribers.py stats
```

### Task 7: Manually Add a Subscriber
Use the web dashboard or call the API directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://niexv1rw75.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/subscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"newuser@example.com"}'
```

```

### Unsubscribe
```
GET https://niexv1rw75.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/unsubscribe?email=user@example.com
```

### Track Email Open
```
GET https://niexv1rw75.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/track/open/{tracking_id}
```

### Track Link Click

## Troubleshooting

### Subscribers Not Receiving Emails
1. Check SES sending limits: `aws ses get-send-quota --region us-east-1`
2. Verify email is in database: `python manage_subscribers.py search email@example.com`
3. Check CloudWatch logs: `aws logs tail /aws/lambda/email-subscription-handler --since 1h`
4. Verify SES email is verified: `aws ses get-identity-verification-attributes --identities contact@christianconservativestoday.com`

### Emails Going to Spam
- Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
- Use SES custom MAIL FROM domain
- Avoid spam trigger words
- Include unsubscribe link
- Maintain good engagement rates

### Export Not Working
```bash
# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Test DynamoDB access
aws dynamodb scan --table-name email-subscribers --limit 1
```

### Dashboard Not Loading
1. Check API endpoint in dashboard.html matches your API Gateway URL
2. Verify CORS is enabled on API Gateway
3. Check browser console for errors

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Exports**: Export your list weekly as backup
2. **Clean Your List**: Remove inactive subscribers quarterly
3. **Monitor Engagement**: Check analytics after each campaign
4. **Test Emails**: Send test emails before campaigns
5. **Respect Unsubscribes**: Never re-add unsubscribed users
6. **Segment Your List**: Consider adding tags/categories for targeting
7. **Track Performance**: Monitor open rates (aim for >20%) and click rates (aim for >2%)
