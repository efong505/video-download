Fix Bible verse lookup system - restore functionality and correct KJV translation

Problem: Bible verse lookup failing with 500 errors after requests module removal
Secondary Issue: KJV selection returning World English Bible instead of King James Version

Resolution:
- Created proper Lambda deployment package with requests library and all dependencies
- Fixed KJV translation issue by explicitly requesting translation parameter
- Updated URL construction for consistent behavior across all translations
- Deployed complete package with requests, urllib3, certifi, charset_normalizer, idna modules

Technical changes:
- articles_api/index.py: Fixed KJV URL to use ?translation=kjv parameter
- articles_api/index.py: Updated fallback URLs to explicitly request KJV translation
- Lambda package: Added requests library and dependencies (CodeSize increased to ~1MB)
- URL pattern: All translations now use explicit translation parameter for consistency

Bible API Integration:
- KJV: Now returns proper King James Version text
- ASV: American Standard Version (1901) working correctly
- YLT: Young's Literal Translation (NT only) working correctly
- Fallback: Unsupported translations properly fall back to KJV with user notification

Result: Bible verse lookup fully operational in both create-article.html and edit-article.html
Status: All Bible translations working correctly with proper version text
